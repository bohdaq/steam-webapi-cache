Bionite: Origins simulates a real time battlefield using a multitude of vehicles and characters. Players can participate as Commanders or Pilots. Commanders can: build bases, manage resources, command troops, coordinate and issue orders, assign assets to other players, and participate in battle in first person. Commanders can also use a &quot;command view' that is an articulating satellite view for quick and efficient base building and executing battlefield tactics. Pilots can drive various vehicles or play as a character, with a seamless transition into or out of the tank cockpits.  Pilots do not have any commanding abilities however wingmen can be assigned to their squad by the Commander.  Once a wingman has been assigned to a Pilot, that player can issue orders and command only the wingmen in their squad.<br><br>The game is designed for online head to head games of 1 vs 1, however games can consist of up to 8 player on each team.
