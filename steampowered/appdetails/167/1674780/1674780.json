You are however never forced to parry and you can even change how the parry system works by equipping Emblems!<br><br>Emblems are items you will find all over the world. Equipping an Emblem might change how the parried projectile behaves, for instance you can make it home into enemies but deal less damage. Or instead of bounce a projectile off your cap you will do damage to anything near you. There is even a Vortex Emblem which destroys multiple projectiles around the player.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1674780\/extras\/cropped_items.png?t=1656922212\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades and Build customizations<\/h2><br>In addition to Emblems there are Relics which work very similarly to the Charm system in Hollow Knight. Some change how your healing works, other increase your sword damage or give you additional protection. There are currently 35+ Relics in the game and you chose what your strengths will be through the Relics. You can make some really specialized builds focusing on defense, healing, speed, melee attacking or spell-casting!<br><br>And then there are permanent upgrades which you gain from fighting bosses, these are all from spells to new moves and types of attacks!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1674780\/extras\/cropped_boss.gif?t=1656922212\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bosses<\/h2><br>Lone Fungus currently features 21 bosses you can fight and gain new powers by beating them!
