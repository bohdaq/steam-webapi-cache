Another Dungeon Game has been designed with casual players in mind, making it quick and easy to dive right in and start slaying from level 1.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Action RPG for Everyone!<\/h2>Millions of players love the thrill that can only be found in the Loot-Driven Action RPG genre, but many of them lack the time or the means to spend countless hours learning the complex mechanics and grinding out the perfect gear. Another Dungeon Game strives to remove the steep learning curves and time sinks found in other games and make the excitement of designing builds and ripping through enemies accessible to as many players as possible, without taking away what makes the genre so special.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Character to Shape However You Want!<\/h2>When creating a character, choose from one of three classes: The Brute, The Ranger, or The Wizard. After that, you make all the decisions on how to grow your character. Allocate stat points into their primary attributes, spend passive points on their various class trees, and use skill points to upgrade and shape their skills into something new. <br><br><br>Don't like how you spent your points? No problem. All aspects of your character can be reset and redistributed as many times as you like for no cost, so experiment, try out new ideas, and rest easy knowing there is no mistake that cannot easily be undone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Here, There be Monsters (to Slay)!<\/h2>Explore randomly generated dungeon maps filled with enemies, loot, and events for you to find. The monsters that dwell on these floors bear randomized traits that make them almost as diverse as the items that they drop. From common fodder to powerful legendary foes, there are always more enemies to slay and more dungeons to explore if you are brave enough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Infinite Dungeon<\/h2>Once the current dungeon has been cleared, you are presented with the choice to return to town, or delve further into the Infinite Dungeon. If you choose to go deeper, you must select a randomized set of mods to apply to all future floors in the current run. The longer you go, the harder it gets, but greater too are the rewards that can be found...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Journey Has Only Just Begun!<\/h2>Another Dungeon Game is still in development by a solo developer who loves this game and its players. Loads of new content is planned for the future, and all content updates are 100% free. Another Dungeon Game has no microtransactions, no cash shop, and no DLC Expansions are currently planned and would only occur after full release.
