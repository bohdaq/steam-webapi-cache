It found that 75% of adults preferred games without explicit violence, 80% preferred games with movie-like dialogue, and 83% preferred games that did not sexually objectify women. These results were the same for both gamers (73% of the sample) and non-gamers. Perhaps most interesting, 86% of adults said they would be specifically interested in a game made by an all-female team. <br><br>Mama Makes Games is trying to make high-quality games for a much broader and more diverse audience than can be reached by the gaming industry's focus on action and horror movie clichés. Just as <i>Frozen<\/i> had a far larger audience than <i>Rambo<\/i>, Mama Makes Games' leadership believes that there is a much bigger audience for story-driven action-adventure games that incorporate the more accessible and prosocial content common in popular movies and literature.<br><br> <i>The Lost Weld<\/i> delivers hours of action and excitement without any violence or gore. The player must directly solve problems through a variety of magical and physical methods, but never harms or kills anyone. In The Lost Weld, the protagonist and most of the main characters are women, but none are portrayed in an objectifying way. These female characters are presented with a variety of body types, ages, and racial features. The Lost Weld is a genuinely female-led project, with all development and creative leadership roles done by women. The game’s design and aesthetics reflect perspectives and ideas that stem from this female leadership.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who's Making this Game<\/h2><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1673070\/extras\/kim-tlw.jpg?t=1654722632\" \/><br><strong>KIMBERLY BLAIS<\/strong><br><i>Game Designer, Developer, and Writer<\/i><br><br>The founder of Mama Makes Games, Kimberly Blais first became interested in developing games as co-founder of a software startup that was granted fifteen patents related to e-learning.
