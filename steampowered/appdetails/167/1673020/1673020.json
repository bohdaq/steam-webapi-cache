Don’t let your guard down, or they will ruin you.”<\/i><br><br>Yuel was only six years old when he witnessed his mother being put to death, for the heinous crime of daring to have an affair. For other women, such a folly mightn’t have been so lethal, but for Yuel’s ill-fated mother – the wife and queen of Indra’s tyrannical king, Khalil – it spelt her doom.<br><br>As he witnesses his mother’s corpse decomposing beneath the intense sunlight, Yuel’s father offers him some sage words of wisdom: namely, not to trust women. They are, in Khalil’s words, wicked and deceitful, and becoming too attached can end in nothing save disaster.<br><br>Outwardly, Yuel must swallow his sorrow, for fear of earning his father’s ire. Kings are not, after all, supposed to cry; even future kings such as him. In private, however, Yuel turns to his nursemaid, the kindly Safiya, for succour. Safiya is Yuel’s only ally in the palace: his father cold and distant; the servants deferential, brow-beaten, and kept silent through fear. Without Safiya, Yuel would be all alone...<br><br>Yet she, too, abandons him, when Yuel grows old enough to no longer need a nursemaid to tend to him.<br><br>Bereft and embittered, Yuel has nothing to look forward to, until – after a prolonged illness – his father eventually dies, and Yuel inherits the throne and the crown in his stead.<br><br>No longer a young boy – Safiya’s ‘little prince’ – but a grown man, Yuel plots to win Safiya over once more. Unable to forget about her, and unable to trust any other woman, Yuel cannot conceive of a life without her. She did promise to stay with him, after all - and, single-minded to a fault, Yuel is determined to see this promise fulfilled at any cost.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1673020\/extras\/features.png?t=1657257430\" \/><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>About 90,000 words of text (approx 4-6 hours of reading)<br><\/li><li> A kinetic story with no choices\/branches<br><\/li><li> Detailed background and character art<br><\/li><li> A custom soundtrack<br><\/li><li> A highly dysfunctional relationship<br><\/li><li> Free patch that adds uncensored r18 content<br><\/li><li> Complete and utter agony ❤︎<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1673020\/extras\/story.png?t=1657257430\" \/><br><br><i>“Women are snakes and liars, all of them: the more beautiful, the more conniving.
