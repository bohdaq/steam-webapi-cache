Surrounded by devoted scallywags and scurvy seadogs in his island fortress, the Pirate King looms over the southern seas like a shadow of menace and legend. To some he is a symbol of liberty, keeping tyrants at bay with equal parts cunning and cruelty, and those seeking to take him down must offer to their fellow pirate lords and ladies the promise of maintaining the freedom of the seas for simple sailors to make a dishonest living. To others, the Pirate King is a purveyor of perfidy and a plunderer without peer, a nautical knave who must be brought back in chains or in pieces if the backbone of the pirate menace is ever to be broken. Your heroes must take up the challenge to topple the suzerain of the seven seas and claim the Typhoon Throne for their own.
