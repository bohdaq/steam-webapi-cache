Besides normal combat mode, players can choose to attack certain limbs and making special targeted attacks. <br><\/li><li>Customization is king - like the Mythic Legions toy line, players can customize their characters at a very high level and add details to their characters body, armor, weapons, clothing, accessories – no 2 characters will be the same<br><\/li><li>Players will build a “special ops” team within the faction they choose and will follow the storyline getting into battles, side missions and boss battles to advance in the game and unlock levels and rewards.<br><\/li><li>One of the coolest features is that players will be able to play the storyline of a certain faction, and then go back and play the storyline as a different one.

Which will allow them to build up their characters skills and powers. Players can decide to change their character skins during the game (say from Knight to Barbarian) and the skill\/power they’ve already built up will automatically transfer over. This also includes when players decide to switch storylines to a different faction. For example, if you build up a character to a 20 during one storyline, you will start the other storyline with a 20 so you are not starting over. The games AI will scale automatically.<\/li><\/ul><br>STORYLINES<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>War of the Aetherblade is the 1st season of the Mythic Legions Tactics game and is set in the high-fantasy world of Mythic Legions with Humans, Elves, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, Undead Skeletons and Vampires, and more<br><\/li><li>The game’s story starts with the coronation of the Elven Queen Artemyss Silverchord at Castle Silverhorn. During the ceremony, the castle is attacked by the Legion of Arethyr and the mystical Aetherblade sword is stolen. Queen Artemyss’s legion, along with other factions and splinter cells, are now racing to win back control of the Aetherblade before it falls into the hands of its master Arethyr and he lays waste to the realm of Mythoss.<br><\/li><li>Play the storyline as different factions – Mythic Legions has a deep storyline and there will be 5 factions included in the Single Player game. <br><\/li><li>When a player does decide to switch factions, the skill and power levels that they’ve already built up will be transferred to their new storyline. So players don’t have to start from scratch.<br><\/li><li>Boss Battles – every Faction will feature a boss battle featuring one of the core characters from the Mythic Legions universe<br><\/li><li>Side Missions – Each storyline will have side missions (like a jail break out) and challenges that will either advance the story or unlock bonuses. <\/li><\/ul><br>WHAT MAKES MYTHIC LEGIONS TACTICS UNIQUE?<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3D Realistic Levels - Most Tactics games are 2D and won't let you rotate the camera around to see different angles.  The few 3D Tactics games that exist are made where the environment itself is made of just a bunch of textured 3D squares of Hexes instead of more realistic environments.  Instead we place the Hex grid over the environment instead of making it using them.  <br><\/li><li>Visual Customization - Lots of games allow for visual customizations, but we believe we have taken it much further.  Not only are we customizing the standard things like skin color, face, hair, tattoos, but every piece of armor and weapon can be recolored to any color, mix and matched between different types, and effects can be added to each such as flames or frost.  The customizer in this game will literally let anyone create a digital action figure and pose them in a display environment as well as shared with anyone to see your collection.<br><\/li><li>Slot Based Characters - This is slightly more difficult to explain.  The basic concept is that all of the character data is stored in a specific slot.  Since Mythic Legions Tactics lets you play 5 Single Player Faction storylines as well as Multiplayer battles, we didn't want the player to always have to start back off at level 1 every time they choose a different story or played Multiplayer.  So to accomplish this you can create a different playable Character for each Faction storyline and even different ones for Multiplayer all within the same slot allowing the slot to level up. This slot continues to grow the more the player plays the game, so no matter if you are playing Single Player stories or Multiplayer battles, the Slot keeps its experience, Skills, and unlocked Classes.<br><\/li><li>No Pay To Win (Everything is Skill Based) - Well when we set out to make this game, one of the most important elements was to make sure it wasn't something people could just come in, buy a bunch of overpowered equipment, items, etc... and just destroy other people.  So instead we removed ALL stat boosts, specials, and other enhancements from equipment.  We made the game more about how skillful your characters are with each weapon, armor, or item.  So by unlocking a skill, that skill then levels up as the character uses it more there by increasing the stats, attack, defense, etc... of the character.  So the more you play the more your character improves instead of buying that improvement!<br><\/li><li>Melded Classes - This is probably one of the most unique features for Mythic Legions Tactics.  This allows players to essentially merge two different classes into a new one.  As an example, if you leveled your character up to unlock the classes for Priest and Mage.  You could Meld the two into a new hybrid class called a Blue Mage which gives the player access to most of the same Skills and Spells for both classes as well as a few new unique ones to the new hybrid class called Blue Mage.  A more extreme example would be melding a Barbarian with a Necromancer.  Honestly I don't know what the new hybrid class would be called just yet, but they are on opposite sides of the Classes hierarchy with very different Stat requirements.  But at the same time it is absolutely something you could do and allows for people to have a lot more fun trying out the various options for potentially hundreds of unique classes!<br><\/li><li>Turn-Based Strategy with Auto-Battle - Most tactics game battles take a long time to complete even a single one.  Some people love this.  It means you can get 50+ hours of gameplay in a single game.  However, others don't like the tedium of having to choose every action for their characters to attack the enemy.  While it is far more efficient to do so, it also isn't always necessary if you are grinding to level up, or just want to play to see the story.  To make the game more enjoyable for everyone, we have added what are called Battle Templates.  The game will come with a few pre-made ones, but essentially a Battle Template allows you to select a set of predefined rules and action for your characters to follow instead of you having to decide each and every action.  This will let you be able to just Auto-Battle levels by having your team just go through those actions automatically so you can enjoy leveling up, the customization, and the amazing story.  Also, just so everyone knows, Battle-Templates work on both Single Player story levels and Multiplayer!<br><\/li><li>Win Conditions - Normally win conditions in a tactics game are just to defeat everyone.  We are definitely going to have that win condition, but sometimes the win condition might be to sneak past guards and unlock something, get all of your players to a specific area on the map without losing anyone, or incapacitate the enemy instead of kill them.  These different types will offer a variety of gameplay options not seen in strategy tactics games.<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"Discover the world of Mythoss and build your &quot;Mythic Legion&quot; in this innovative, customizable, non-Pay-to-win TACTICS game featuring Fully 3D Realistic Environments, Hundreds of Class options,  and Skill Based Battles!
