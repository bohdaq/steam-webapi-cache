This happens<br \/>\r\n out of ignorance or under pressure from those who benefit from distorting the historical facts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour virtual journey begins in the Spandau Prison dining area recreated from one of the legendary post-war photos. Here, you are met by serenely dining Nuremberg defendants – Göring, Dönitz, Rosenberg, von Ribbentrop and von Schirach. By touching each of them, you can  travel back to<br \/>\r\n these Nazi criminals’ past. Your task is to find evidence of their terrible crimes against humanity in – seemingly – an ordinary and peaceful environment. As you gather more pieces of evidence, you put together a convincing dossier, akin to those ones that<br \/>\r\n the 1946 Nuremberg verdict was based on. Thus you will restore the historical truth.","about_the_game":"This is a detective story in VR, a documentary investigation, brought to you by Rossiya Segodnya.
