{"1711110":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Karvaros","steam_appid":1711110,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Karvaros is a mystical and dangerous place where warring factions fight to stay at the top of the food chain. To do this, they ritualistically, hunt ancient beings known as Guardians. Guardians are born from “The Seed” of the Reef, and are hosts to enormous powers. By killing the Guardians, factions are able to extract some of their powers for legendary weapons or abilities.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n     Players will be choosing factions to join and help strengthen. By completing quests for their factions, with or without the help of others, players will get stronger and stronger to hopefully destroy a Guardian. When players want to test their skills, they can join “The Hunt”, where players from all factions dive into the depths of the ever changing Reef, in search of a Guardian. Players will also have the option to hunt down bounties that their faction may place on players in other factions. This is Karvaros' unique way of recreating the &quot;invader&quot; system the Dark Souls series has established. By successfully slaying their bounties, players gain prestige in their factions which yield nice rewards and special discounts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n     Our vision and goal for Karvaros is to create a souls-like game that will keep players coming back to it, because of its expansive multiplayer that is always rewarding and keeping the players on their toes. We want the best of a souls-like but with a nice touch of what multiplayer games have to offer. Expect procedural map generation for multiplayer situations, unique quests with underlying story, good PVP and of course, fun boss fights.","about_the_game":"Karvaros is a mystical and dangerous place where warring factions fight to stay at the top of the food chain.
