The camouflage shimmers, mesmerizes, and—ouch, that hurts! What's that jingling sound? It's 3,000 gold, credits, and Premium Account!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis bundle includes:<br \/>\r\n• Matilda IV Soviet Tier V Premium medium tank + Garage slot<br \/>\r\n• 9 equipment slots<br \/>\r\n• Shale Luminescence Epic animated camouflage for the Matilda IV<br \/>\r\n• 3,000 gold<br \/>\r\n• 250,000 credits<br \/>\r\n• 14 days of Premium Account<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Matilda IV is a slow-paced but well-armored tank that can withstand many hits. As it aggressively moves forward, it destroys opponents with its quick-firing gun boasting decent single-shot damage. The 14-degree gun depression angle provides the Matilda IV an additional advantage—it can fight effectively on hilly terrain by exposing only the turret to enemy fire.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTogether with the tank, you'll get a certificate for the Shale Luminescence Epic animated camouflage and a solid supply of resources.
