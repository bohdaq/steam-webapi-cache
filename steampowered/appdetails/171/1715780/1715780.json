The player takes on the role of a dungeon core, a human reincarnated as a sentient dungeon, and must defend against waves of invaders. In place of towers, players place traps and dungeon monsters which can be placed directly on the invasion path, where they can attack the invaders, as well as freely move throughout the dungeon. Each dungeon monster also has the ability to be directly controlled by the player, adding action elements to a traditionally passive portion of the gameplay loop. But be careful, your monsters can be slain! Between waves, the player can customize the layout of their dungeon, thus altering the invasion path.

In her human life, Sandra studied all manner of crafting disciplines from leather working to magical enchantments.

That is, if she can protect herself from an onslaught of invaders who want nothing more than to loot her treasures and destroy her very essence.
