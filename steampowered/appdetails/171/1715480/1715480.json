Asymmetrical in nature, the metal and radioactive resources that are distributed on each map are meant to offset their various geographical disadvantages. <br><br>Fight against your enemy on maps of various sizes that feel like you’re fighting somewhere in the real world – which isn’t all that surprising, since that’s what they’re all based on. <br><br>Wage war on the following new maps: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Dubola:<\/strong> This medium map for up to 6 players offers few places to hide and tight maneuverability for your armies.
