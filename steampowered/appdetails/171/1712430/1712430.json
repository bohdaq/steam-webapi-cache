But I have always hated the Klondike implementations that have been available.  Why should I have to click the HINT button to see all of the available moves?  Why should I have to keep hitting the DRAW button to see the next triplet from the Talon?  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, about 15 years ago when I retired from Boeing Computing, I decided to fix these deficiencies and coded my first Klondike.  It had all available moves pre-calculated and shown as buttons.  Press the button and the move is carried out. It had the entire Talon shown at once (again, with move buttons).  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd over the years, as I played my new Klondike, I kept thinking of other things that would be nice to have (without changing the rules).  And I added them.  Like:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStacking Maps - showing all 52 cards in stacking order (red on black) showing where each card is and whether it's theoretically playable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBuild Maps - one for each suit in build-order, showing each card is and whether it's theoretically build-able.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Talon-Lookahead - I can see the entire Talon at once.  As I play cards from the Talon, why not see the Talon as it will be the next time thru?  So this Klondike has a second view of the Talon, the Lookahead-Talon.  Available moves are calculated for both of them and you can even play directly from the Lookahead (which of course causes the Lookahead to become the Talon and a new Lookahead to be computed).  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nConnector-Cards - The main thrust of Klondike is moving cards so that a downcard is exposed for a flip.  Why not have the Klondike programing figure out all of the theoretical opportunities for exposing downcards and display which cards (Connector-Cards) need to be moved in order to do it?  So this Klondike calculates all Connector-Cards and hilites them in yellow on the Stacking Maps and the Build Maps.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Have-We-Lost Algorithm  -  If a game becomes  theoretically impossible to win, I want to know right away, so I can resign and go on to a deal that isn't theoretically impossible.  (Life is short!)  It took me three years of development, but this Klondike's Have-We-Lost Algorithm is killer.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo what do all of these improvements do to the game?  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWell, the rules are still exactly the same.  And Klondike's anti-anxiety properties are still there.  But with all of the added visibility, you can really see what's going on.  So the game becomes more of a puzzle-to-be-solved.  And it allows for some strategies that you never even thought of before.  And it is way, way more fun!  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, I'm thinking that there must be some other Klondike nuts out there who will enjoy this re-imagined Klondike as much as I do.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMike Edwards","about_the_game":"I'm a solitaire nut.
