{"1712530":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation","steam_appid":1712530,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Syphilisation is a post-colonial parody of the 4X genre. In it, I take the established tropes of 4X games and attempt to show post-colonial alternatives to each of them. Most notably, Syphilisation frames human struggle as a common striving for a better world rather than a furious competition between ourselves. There's a lot of space left uneXplored in the 4X space and Syphilisation aims to show some of what more is possible.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n In Syphilisation, you play as a student doing a group report on Gandhi, Churchill and colonization as a whole. In doing so, you will research actual facts about the events of the time, including the Dandi March,  Appeasement and the history of Ahimsa. You also learn about the students doing the report and their stories. Also, as anyone who has had to do a group report knows, the politics of nations are just the politics of student groups writ large.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is a game where you can try empathy though. If you wish to play opportunistically, this game is not going to stop you, but will let you try an alternative if you prefer. More than one player can win and you're able to help others as much as you can hinder.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's also a game that tries to show something of history from below. The citizens of your empire have many requests of their own and will often just handle them by themselves rather than wait for you to get around to them. They will research new technologies, complete buildings and units and simply deal with their issues by themselves. You can make yourself more popular by getting there first, but Syphilisation understands that leaders need the people and not the other way around.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEverything in this game, from campaigns to technology to settling all try to present a system that is not underpinned by imperialism and so present something novel in this 4X space. This is a game of ideas and I hope you like them.","about_the_game":"Syphilisation is a post-colonial parody of the 4X genre.
