The game scene is the style of ancient Chinese architecture, which is not important, but the dialogue with NPC. This is a simple game, and NPC dialogue does not need you to run around.

What is the meaning of living? Where do people come from? Where do people go after death? This is a concern of many people. Twenty years ago, I completed the study of the cycle of the universe. Fifteen years ago, when I studied the 33 dimensional space-time, I came to the conclusion that matter, space and time did not exist, and then I turned to the study of theology. Here, I will tell you the answers to these questions in the simplest language according to my own research. I hope my answer is correct, and I hope you like it.

Originally, I wanted to make a multiplayer online RPG online game. But during the Spring Festival, I found that in our country, individuals can not release and operate online games. So I decided to make the simplest game first, so this game appeared. The theme of the game, I did not think better, I also do not like to make random, so I used to care about, often thinking things out of the game, put in the game. This game has no fighting pleasure and visual wonderful experience. For the dialogue content in the game, many people should not be interested in it. It is likely that there is no subsequent version of the game. If you have bought the game and read the dialogue content in the game, you regret to buy it, you can apply for a refund, I think Steam should agree. Of course, if a lot of people like the dialogue content in the game, there may be a new version.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What kind of game is this?<\/strong><\/h2>This is a very simple 3D single game, only a simple dialogue, the operation of the game and most of the same 3D games.
