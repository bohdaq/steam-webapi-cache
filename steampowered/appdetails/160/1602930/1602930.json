(Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. It's also rare to find those games with full audio dialogue transcribed into other languages. Pedro's Adventures uses simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. That said, we would recommend that you try playing some of your favorite RPGs in Spanish. If you are able to understand all your objectives then congratulations! Your Spanish is already quite excellent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Everything is in Spanish without translation? Won't I feel overwhelmed?&quot;<\/h2>Sometimes, yes! But don't be discouraged, you can absolutely complete this game even if you don't understand every word that's being said. If you can persevere you'll find that you're still able to understand your objectives and how to achieve them. New language learners often find themselves quite overwhelmed when first attempting to interact in the language they’re studying. This is a natural part of the process. Just watch for keywords and context, and don't be afraid to experiment!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Will this be useful if I want to learn Spanish from Spain (Castilian)?&quot;<\/h2>In short, yes. Especially if you are a beginner. The script and voice performances were done by Latin American Spanish speakers but most of the common verbs and nouns are the same in both variations of the language. Even though some of the words in the game might be less commonly used in Spain, Spaniards and Latinos are typically able to understand each other perfectly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?&quot;<\/h2>If there is sufficient support for Pedro's Adventures then we intend to release it for other languages starting with the romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese etc) and then eventually in Asian languages (Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean etc).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)&quot;<\/h2>Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but if there is sufficient demand for it then down the track we'd love to port the game to macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A WORD FROM THE CREATORS<\/h2>Pedro's Adventures in Spanish is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation.
