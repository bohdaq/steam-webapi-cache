Stonefly’s hopeful respect of the natural world shines through, a showcase of an aspirational balance.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/interviews\/22523571\/stonefly-impressions-interview-flight-school-mech-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >POLYGON<\/a><br><br>“....Provides an intriguing premise that lends itself to strange and fantastical gameplay... Stonefly smartly lets the player control its tempo without lingering for too long, which appeals to all kinds of gamers.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/noisypixel.net\/stonefly-review-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-switch-pc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Noisy Pixel<\/a><br><br>“Stonefly is a thoroughly unique game that has novel gameplay ideas and a wonderful story. Dancing around the world while piloting your mech, trying to find emotional catharsis for your heroine while also beating up some bugs so you can get more resources to upgrade your current ride is a heck of a gameplay loop.
