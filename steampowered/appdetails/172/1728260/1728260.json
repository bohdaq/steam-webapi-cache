Once the volcano blows its top you'll want to run and hide, because it could cause the entire island to burn to the ground. It won't grow back until the Spring, so be sure to think ahead.

At lower levels they are able to pass on small amounts of knowledge on basic skills to individual players, but at higher levels they are able to pass on massive amounts of knowledge to large groups.
