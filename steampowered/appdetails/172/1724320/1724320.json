Just as she's bemoaning her lack of funds, the opportunity she's been searching for hits her... literally!

As if that isn't bad enough, she's given a paltry 10 days to pay back the monstrous 1,000,000 gold she owes!

As you do, you'll accrue Job Points that will allow you to take on a larger variety of requests. Just make sure to keep an eye on your Fatigue! As you work, your Fatigue will gradually increase, and once it hits 100, Noelle will be forced to turn in for the night.<br><br>Once you introduce yourself to Rin, she'll provide jobs that will require you to venture into more dangerous locales, such as Coco Forest. Though Noelle can easily slice through any foe with her sword, try not to get careless. Three hits, and she'll be down for the count. Of course, the various items Rimuru sells can help make your outings a little less risky, but don't go too overboard.
