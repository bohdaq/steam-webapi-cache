They make a total of four habitat animals and one exhibit animal. Construct ideal homes, and fulfil their daily needs, and these European natives will love their new surroundings. Enjoy watching European badgers resting underground as they shelter from the elements, and give your guests a rare view of them by setting up subterranean cameras to cast onto billboards. In addition, the Europe Pack comes with three new enrichment items to keep your animals entertained. Alpine ibex can use the Goat Climbing Mountain’s clustered boulders to display their nimble traversal skills; European fallow deer and Alpine ibex can enjoy meals from Scarecrow Feeders; and Eurasian lynx can use the rough surfaces of Rubbing Pad Bark to scratch their itches. Existing animals can also make use of these items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">250+ BOLD NEW SCENERY PIECES<\/h2>Build and decorate using fresh creative options inspired by picturesque European locations, including iconic cities such as Venice and Amsterdam. Erect ornate bridges over shimmering bodies of water; add native foliage including London plane tree, cork oak, and grape vine, and put up new medieval-themed animal signs. You can even ring in the holiday season with sparkling fairy lights and decorations – make your very own festive village or winter market!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN EXCITING NEW SCENARIO<\/h2>Al’s Pine Zoo’s owners want you to introduce as many different species as possible before the holiday season: are you up to the challenge?
