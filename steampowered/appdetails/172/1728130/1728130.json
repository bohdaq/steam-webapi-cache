Instead, points will be earned from levels that can be spent in two unique skill books to each character. Don't like your current skills? Visit the pub to reset them.

Alone wants to throw that out the window and introduce more punishing and difficult bosses as a result. Potions may heal you for a substantial amount, but that health is then lost again over time. The turn order can also be manipulated by clever players who take advantage of the ACCEL system. Spells \/ items \/ actions will have an ACCEL value to them that causes that characters next turn to come up quicker by that amount. Your enemies will target the strongest among you and do everything they can to throw a wrench in your plans.
