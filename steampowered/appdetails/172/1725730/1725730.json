It is easy to learn and has an easy understandable C++ style syntax. <br><br>Your actual game is implemented by creating custom entities, player behaviour and define maps with custom entities. You can just launch the engine GUI builder, create a new project and everything is generated for you. You then just have to modify the entity source files. We suggest to use VS Code as editor.<br><br>Note that this product is quite oldschool: There is no visual scripting or map editor included yet, so this is preferably suited for developers who like to write code.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Casual Game Engine!<\/h2><br>Casual Game Engine is another playground for both gamers and developers.
