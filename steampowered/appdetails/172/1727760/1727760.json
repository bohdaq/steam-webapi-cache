Choose one of two asymmetric factions – Capital or Labor – and lead soldiers that grow and learn dynamically from what happens to them in each battle. Vehicles, air strikes, and artillery all allow you to reshape the destructible buildings and environment of each battlefield.<br><br>In the battle of Capital vs Labor, who will you choose? The Mellon Corporation – Capital – monopolizes the mining of a new rare element with the potential to solve all of Earth’s energy needs. But the workers on Mars – Labor – are exposed to deadly mining conditions and cut off from all regulatory protection they might have enjoyed while on Earth. Will you lead Labor in the rise from a small band of desperate workers scrounging for ammunition and supplies, or accept charge of the vast resources and powerful starting position of Capital (but be forever beholden to the relentless demands of your shareholders on Earth)? <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1727760\/extras\/total_tactical_freedom_gate.gif?t=1657239434\" \/><br>The best of turn-based tactical gameplay, with battlefields designed for destruction.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong><u>Classic Turn-Based Tactical Combat<\/u><\/strong>: Suppression, flanking, cover, line of sight, fog of war, friendly fire, and everything you've come to expect from the genre. <br><\/li><li> <strong><u>360 Aim System<\/u><\/strong>: Your troops can shoot at anything in their line of sight – not just enemies.
