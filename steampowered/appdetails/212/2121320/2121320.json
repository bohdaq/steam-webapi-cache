End matches within the time limit to get out before the Guardians of Defense and Order in the Galaxy (Guard D.O.G.s) , a specialized military unit, who are trying to put an end to the fights and reclaim stolen weapons, show up.<br><br><strong>What is the Black Market?<\/strong><br>The Black Market is the in-game shop where you can purchase new weapons, Stimulants, Upgrade Chips, and other visual aesthetics. You can acquire currency from competing in matches while gaining more if you win the match. You can also spend real money to instantly purchase items as well.<br><br><strong>Weapons and their options<\/strong><br>Each weapon will have 6 abilities spread over 3 tiers. Each tier you will have choice A and choice B, You can respec your weapons any time when you are in the loadout page of the menus.<br><br>When picking your 2 weapons for your build, you will notice that weapons have a bonus or a negative towards your total health pool.<br><br><strong>Buffs &amp; Debuffs<\/strong><br>We plan to be very visual with all buffs and debuffs. Instead of just seeing a bunch of little boxes above your health bar that you may not even be sure what they represent, we plan to implement everything as a visual queue.<br><br><strong>Stimulants &amp; Upgrade Chips<\/strong><br>Stimulants are on-use items such as a Health Stim, which will have a set number of uses per fight and will reset. Not all stimulants will have the same number of uses.<br><br>Upgrade Chips are passives you can choose for your loadout.<br><br><strong>Loadout<\/strong><br>Your loadout is where you will decide your build. Your options will be:<br><br>Weapon A<br>Weapon B<br>Stimulant<br>Upgrade Chip<br><br>This is also where you will select any skins you would like to use. If you do not own a skin, you can purchase them from the shop.<br><br><strong>Dodge<\/strong><br>Dodging is one of several parts of combat you will have to master to gain an edge on your opponent. You can have 1 of 3 types of dodge, Light, Medium, and Heavy dodge. Your dodge type will be directly tied with your TOTAL Health pool which is directly influenced by your weapon choice. Each dodge type will have its own stamina costs and distances gained.<br><br><strong>Blocking<\/strong><br>We wanted to make blocking an active part of combat for any and all builds. The basics will be simple, blocked damage will use your stamina instead of your health. different weapon types will have a different block percentage. Blocks that do not have 100% blocking will split between health and stamina. For instance:<br><br>If you have a shield, you may block 100% physical damage but only 80% magic. If you are hit with 20 Physical damage, you will lose 20 stamina for the block. If you try to block 20 Magic damage, you will take 16 to stamina and 4 to your Health.<br><br><strong>Future Plans<\/strong><br>We have a lot of plans we want to eventually put into the game such as multiple game modes, tons of planned weapons, maps, stimulants, and Upgrade Chips. We would also like to have these modes allow more and more players at one time. All in due time, but we have tons of ideas planned if all goes well.","about_the_game":"<strong>What is the scope of the game?<\/strong><br>This is a 3v3 focused, RANKED Combat Arena. <br><br>Use the Black Market to buy your weapons, upgrades, and more in the pursuit of Ladder ascension and universal fame.
