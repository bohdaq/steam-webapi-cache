It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1592280\/extras\/STORY.png?t=1656112664\" \/><br>The story takes place during a violent invasion of Selaco, the underground facility that's home to the surviving refugees after the fall of Earth. You play as Dawn, an ACE Security Captain who, with her recent promotion and high level security clearances, is digging deep into the truth behind Selaco's murky history. Before she can finish her investigation, Selaco is rocked by explosions and armed invaders. While Selaco may take place in a large-scale conflict, much of it will be the personal story of Dawn, the center-piece of the game.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1592280\/extras\/FEATURES.gif?t=1656112664\" \/><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A lengthy story-driven campaign<\/li><\/ul>Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly.
