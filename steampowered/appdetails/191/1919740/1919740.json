Players can have an immersive plot experience from the perspective of two protagonists. The game combines reality with reality, and film clips are interspersed in the process of the game. The film cast is composed of many old opera bones such as Liu Zhiyang, Zhang Zijian and Wang Kuirong. It has played familiar roles in well-known film and television dramas such as soul ferry and detective Di Renjie. The story is shrouded in a strange atmosphere at the beginning, and the whole process is high-energy. If you are also a fan of thriller suspense films, it will definitely be a palace level enjoyment.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe are a group of young people who love to play drum games and write novels. We can't stop the thriller novels about reasoning and solving cases. By chance, we got the movie script of Fengtian, and we decided to make it a game! In addition to the main plot, we also added multiple endings to make the character image fuller and the story line richer. The game integrates the plot story and the current mainstream decryption playing method. The plot is tense and the playing method burns the brain. In addition to decryption, the game adds a lot of trial content. Players catch the murderer through clues between different characters to test everyone's logical reasoning ability.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn the production of the game, we uphold the spirit of respecting Chinese traditional history and culture. We have read a lot of materials to verify the design of the scene, the customs of white affairs and the costumes of the characters, and invited authoritative professors of history to supervise the production of the game. The seemingly inadvertent small details are the result of our repeated polishing. I hope the works we try for the first time can get everyone's support. In addition, we are also creating scripts simultaneously. If you are interested, you can leave your attention!","about_the_game":"On the Zhongyuan Festival, in Taiping County, a dark theater is staged for the ghost king of Yinshan.
