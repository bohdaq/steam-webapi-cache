The retro Game Boy styled visuals are excellent, it has multiple endings to discover and the fishing is genuinely fun – largely because you never know what you’re going to pull up from the depths. A fantastic freaky little fishing expedition well worth taking.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.alphabetagamer.com\/fishing-vacation-game-jam-build-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >AlphaBetaGamer<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1918300\/header.jpg?t=1650605735","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 64-bit<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 40 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Anything<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Anything<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Teebowah Games","LameboySP"],"publishers":["Teebowah Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":4000,"final":4000,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"40₴"},"packages":[690949],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Fishing Vacation","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":690949,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Fishing Vacation -
