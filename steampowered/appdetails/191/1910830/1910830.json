Not with actual horses running around the deck, but six wooden horses would be brought into the ship's main lounge. These horses would run on a short grid track and move based on the roll of a die. If the dice roll was 6, horse number 6 would move one grid square.  This would continue until one horse crossed the finish line and came in first. <br><br>Passengers would bet on the winner number of the race,  and the betting odds and payoffs were based on the total amount bet by all the passengers in a true horse racing para-mutual system.

There are also race statistics to help with your wagering selections, showing which horse numbers have been in the money the most times in recent races.<br><br>You can track your success by using your winning dollars to purchase one or more of the the original horse art rewards we have created exclusively for this game, maybe you will unlock a rare or legendary piece of horse art.<br><br>We hope you will enjoy this game, sign up for our newsletter (no spam) and send us your feedback. And be sure to watch the game videos on our YouTube channel.<br><br>There are no ads or in-game purchases, and Cruise Ship Horse Racing is designed to be played online or offline.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cruise Ship Horse Racing<\/strong><\/h2><br><strong>Backstory:<\/strong><br><br>Not that long ago ocean going passenger cruise ship liners were used primarily to ferry people across the oceans of the world.
