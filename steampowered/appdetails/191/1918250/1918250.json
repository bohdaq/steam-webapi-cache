She has a habit of frequently sharing pictures of whatever she's eating on the Succubus Kingdom's one social media network, Incugram. Ruk is generally friendly and kindhearted, but naively believes Lima is not deserving of the position she's in, and though not out of spite, she will speak ill of Lima at times. She also considers humans to be inferior beings to succubi, but that belief as well, is not one of malice. Her body is pleasantly plump, and her features are gentle--if not maternal. She speaks in a refined manner befitting of someone with such a dignified--albeit sheltered--background, but much of what she says is either foolish or downright silly.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1918250\/extras\/ikuiku-character-banners_Ico2.png?t=1658268382\" \/><br><br>Ico belongs to the Bicorn clan, a type of horned-beast succubi known for their radical militancy.
