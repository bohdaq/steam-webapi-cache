Although the game isn't a pearl diving simulator, the theme of the game is symbolized behind it. The actual concept of the game however is a traditional point based collection experience.

Pearl diving was one of Qatar's main industries until the early 1930’s. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPearl diving was risky and physically taxing. The lack of oxygen, the fast change in water pressure and surrounding marine predators made pearl diving a very dangerous profession.
