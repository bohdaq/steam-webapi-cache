Ten light-years away, as one of Earth's main Space Stations approaches Dracon Ismenios' orbit, attracted by signals of a high density of precious minerals, a group of space mercenaries known as Nortens attacks the colony, taking the surviving crew hostage. During a training session on Earth’s International Mission's basecamp you receive an S.O.S. from the Station and, against your superiors' orders, you immediately steal a spaceship and embark on a solitary journey to save the survivors, knowing that among them is your son. When your spaceship gets damaged and falls on Dracon Ismenios, your mission will be to find a way back, before it is too late.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES<\/strong><\/h2>Explore the breathtaking sceneries of an alien planet filled with beauty and danger, on a quest to repair your spaceship and save your son.
