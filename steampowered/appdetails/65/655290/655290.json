Collect resources and build a modular raft. Learn and master realistic sailing mechanics with different difficulty levels. Build a shelter to protect you from the challenging Pacific-like weather and seasons. Hunt for food, craft tools and weapons, build a sundial to determine the time of the day, use the sextant to find out your global position, and draw your map from scratch using the triangulation method. Explore the endless world based on islands and island clusters. Simulate real-life scenarios and learn how to survive in the wild Pacific!<\/h2><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/655290\/extras\/HEADING_Build_a_raft_and_explore_the_pacific.png?t=1658259682\" \/><br>Build a modular raft from scratch and explore the full area of the real Pacific. You can build a raft with just a captain’s cabin on it or you can go crazy and build a survival floating base with chests for storage, drying racks for food preservation, sleeping arrangements, item holders and so on. The decision is yours. The realistic sailing mechanics enable you to learn how to sail. You can start with the beginner-friendly easy mode and switch to a more advanced one once you mastered your raft.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/655290\/extras\/EtP_GIF_Build-Raft-Explore_with_menu.gif?t=1658259682\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/655290\/extras\/HEADING_Cartography_and_Navigation.png?t=1658259682\" \/><br>Scavenge the waters and surrounding islands for clues and items.

With up to 27 different weather factors the player can simulate a plethora of realistic scenarios: Hot, cold, dry, windy, calm and many more combinations. The in-game weather (wind, temperature, rain etc.) and seasons are based on the day of the year and the actual latitudinal position of the player on the global map. Items can get wet, and while wet wood is perfect to smoke food, it can be deadly when the player is suffering from starvation and can’t light up a fire. Everything is dynamic in this game. While the strong wind is perfect for sailing, it can cause the rain to fall at an angle and reach the inside of a building through a window.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/655290\/extras\/EtP_GIF_Environment-Weather-seasons_HIGH.gif?t=1658259682\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/655290\/extras\/HEADING_Building,_Crafting_and_Cooking.png?t=1658259682\" \/><br>Build, craft and cook with the help of blueprints in three simple steps: Place the desired blueprint, add the required resources and finalize it by either using a tool (hammer) or by placing it on a cooking spot (in case of a recipe).
