{"1610910":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Adventure Forever","steam_appid":1610910,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Adventure Forever is an infinite, open-world, procedurally-generated Fantasy RPG with simulation elements.  As you manage exploring the unkempt wilderness, diving into spooky dungeons, solving world-spanning quests and fighting epic battles you are simultaneously teaching your characters what they are, and how they should behave.  Classes in Adventure Forever aren't chosen so much as grown.  Everything you have the characters do affects what they are and what they become.  Practice makes perfect.  To specialize in a particular weapon, you simply use the weapon and your character naturally becomes proficient over time.  To become a powerful wizard you have to try casting ever more complex spells.  The more hits you take in battle and survive, the beefier your hit point total grows.  The more locks and pockets a thief picks, the better she can do so again in the future.  Likewise, if you don't use a skill for too long your characters slowly lose proficiency.  Thieves who don't pick locks eventually forget how.  Fighters who never engage in battle become weaker over time.  Wizards who don't cast a particular spell for too long might discover it costs more mana than they expected, assuming they remember how to cast it at all.  Even being left or right handed depends on which hand you have them use most.   When you get tired of training the AI, you can let go of the wheel by choosing a favorite member to play and the rest of your party will continue to battle, explore and even attempt to complete quests in the manner you've taught them as you journey along side and support your party's progress.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe world and dungeons of Adventure Forever are procedurally generated out of programmable, pluggable story beats that can connect together to form complex and nuanced questlines.  The creatures that inhabit the world can become aware of the quests and may attempt to thwart the player, of even attempt to complete the quests before the player if doing so matches their motivations.  The release version of the game will include an API for extending the base game with new story beats, creatures and world elements that will automatically be integrated into new worlds.","about_the_game":"Adventure Forever is an infinite, open-world, procedurally-generated Fantasy RPG with simulation elements.
