Move from star to star, dispatching waves of procedurally-generated enemies. Each level is its own Solar System, with planets and asteroids to hide behind.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/header.jpg?t=1651529093","website":"https:\/\/spacemarmalade.mailchimpsites.com\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> 1280x720 minimum resolution, OpenGL 2.0 Support, and recommended dedicated graphics card with 128 MB of RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["James Bradbury","Chase Bethea"],"publishers":[" Raw Orange Studios Limited"],"demos":[{"appid":1984460,"description":""}],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"3","description":"RPG"},{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_499cf678999cea7d696e504f81e6235fb997b920.600x338.jpg?t=1651529093","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_499cf678999cea7d696e504f81e6235fb997b920.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651529093"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_65a72aa817141899a5503c8a2614a60e80bde87a.600x338.jpg?t=1651529093","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_65a72aa817141899a5503c8a2614a60e80bde87a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651529093"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_3c5cc2ca819c84441490dc588058909a0261ceef.600x338.jpg?t=1651529093","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_3c5cc2ca819c84441490dc588058909a0261ceef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651529093"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_0b80f6a702e36456a717a363d16f491f170ea886.600x338.jpg?t=1651529093","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_0b80f6a702e36456a717a363d16f491f170ea886.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651529093"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_11114449094c4a7e74d3f64e5363fd5f2ea28606.600x338.jpg?t=1651529093","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/ss_11114449094c4a7e74d3f64e5363fd5f2ea28606.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651529093"}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":true,"date":"when it's ready!"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"space.marmalade@hotmail.com"},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651529093","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1615070\/page.bg.jpg?t=1651529093","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
