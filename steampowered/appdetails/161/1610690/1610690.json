Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are:<br><br>• <strong>COM-10 SMG<\/strong>  - The COM-10 is a high recoil yet very fast firing SMG that is sometimes used by the US army in special operations. <br><br>•<strong> S21<\/strong> - A sniper version of the classic S14 battle rifle with improved accuracy and adjustments to fit a scope mount. <br><br>• <strong>G79 Grenade Launcher<\/strong> - The G79 was created by the US army to grant infantry an impressive mix of firepower, range and accuracy and at the same time achieve being more portable than a mortar. <br><br>Weapon attachments included:<br>• <strong>COM-10 Silencer<\/strong> - A unique silencer for the COM-10. Attaching this mod will significantly reduce the noise created by each shot.<br>• <strong>COM-10 Extended Magazine<\/strong> - An extended magazine for the COM-10 SMG.

This low-velocity shell is capable of dealing moderate explosive damage to armored targets.<br>•<strong> G79 EMP Grenade<\/strong> - A non-damaging, electromagnetic pulse round that fits the G79 Grenade Launcher.
