As the cool night air drains the heat from the sand, you &amp; your friends huddle around your campfire, glancing nervously at the giant pyramid in the distance. Gradually, the winds change direction, bearing a thin streak of white mist toward you from the pyramid. It swirls &amp; takes shape as a faceless man dressed in ancient robes &amp; an ornate head-piece; moonlight shining through his ghostly body &amp; robes, he lifts his arms toward the pyramid &amp; speaks. It was magic that conveyed you all to Bralizar, &amp; an ancient map that guided you through the pass in The Dustwall. But it was, after all, the tales that finally brought you to this place - tales of endless wealth, of spirit-guarded pyramids, of crystalline obelisks, of gemstones with mysterious properties. Now, as the haunted voice of the spectre before you begins his tale, you wonder if the treasure &amp; the quest are worth the price...perhaps your very lives.
