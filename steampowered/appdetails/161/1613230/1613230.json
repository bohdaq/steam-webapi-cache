Dynamic fights and Fun - are main pillars of  this game. You dont have to wait for movies or read very carefully NPS stories, just GO and KILL THEM ALL !!!  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGameplay - as was mentioned before, this is first-person shooter with all characteristics.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt this moment there are 19 stages of survival stages - where you have 5 types of weapon max and you kill all your enemies that you see to get on the next level. Threre are 18 types of enemies and different situations where you have to survive, and believe me, it wont be easy.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlso 16 stages of jumping area, if you need something else, <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you feel stuck , then you can always take any stage you want, but i recomend you to make step by step, because if you wont make lvl 4 for example, then lvl 5 will be harder for you. You have to understand logic and grow up as player, then next stage will be easier.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAbout technical features - this is my first game  on Unreal Engine 4 , that was made 100% on blueprints. Project is not perfect, mostly because of my experience, however it is question of time and game will become better and better.  I believe , that this method of making games has fantastic future and I hope, that this project will inspire other people to become developers. Lets make something special guys !","about_the_game":"ShootRun is a classic,  first-person shooter with dynamic fights , arena looking area , different and interesting enemies  and hard situations.
