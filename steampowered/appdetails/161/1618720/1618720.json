Consequently, the Mars Society has built this first Steam release to allow everyone the chance to tour the MDRS and better understand analog science, technology, and procedures.  While this version is a pre-release taster focused mainly on the environment and building exteriors, the final version (expected to be released within a few months) will include the ability to explore the interior spaces, and conduct optional training scenarios where crew members learn to conduct a Mars analog simulation in real life. Our end goal is to give everyone a taste of what it will take to visit, build a habitat, and thrive on Mars.","about_the_game":"The Mars Society, the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the human exploration of Mars, operates the Mars Virtual Reality (MarsVR) program to create engineering-grade virtual reality simulations of future human Mars exploration.
