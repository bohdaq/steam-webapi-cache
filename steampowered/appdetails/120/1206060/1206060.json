small percentage of people may experience discomfort or seizures when exposed to flashing lights, so please be cautious if you are sensitive to either flashing imagery, blood, or violence. There's rarely anything but that to see in Happy Game.\r\n\r\nHappy Game also depicts various fantasy characters participating in highly absurd comical violence. You'll often see blood on the floor (best case scenario), witness the decapitation of adorable bunnies, and much more. No filter.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Happy Game is not a happy game."}}}}
