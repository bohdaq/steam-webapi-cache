You can also choose your own path through the game by selecting different planets leading to unique stages, each with their own gameplay and style. This game is a spiritual successor to one of my previous works, The Bits That Saved the Universe. Revisit the universe of bits with a new and improved art style, new engine and original soundtrack.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is a complete overhaul of the original with all new planets and areas, but still keeping the same four-player co-op fun. Travel to different planets and engage in different environments, different play styles and unique enemies!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'd strongly recommend using a gamepad, perferrably an XBox type controller, especially if you're playing with multiple people. The game will natively detect gamepads, but if it doesn't work, you can use a controller to keyboard mapping program like Joy2Key or AntiMicro.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you have to use a keyboard, here are the controls:<br \/>\r\nPLAYER ONE:<br \/>\r\nArrows - Move<br \/>\r\nX - Jump<br \/>\r\nC - Shoot<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPLAYER TWO:<br \/>\r\nWASD - Move<br \/>\r\nN - Jump<br \/>\r\nM - Shoot<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs always, good luck and have fun!<br \/>\r\nJ.C.","about_the_game":"Once upon a time...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn a galaxy not far from our own...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Bits That Saved the Galaxy is a four player co-op platform shooter in the same vein as games like Contra, but utilizing lo-fi graphics and visual effects.
