It aims to give players an empathetic understanding of OCD by making them consider their surroundings as an OCD sufferer would. It does this through a series of rhythm game levels designed around the 5 main types of OCD, with each course manipulating the player’s focus into a similar pattern to that of a sufferer of the corresponding OCD type.
