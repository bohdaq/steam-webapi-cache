The game is our 3-man (now) dev team's maiden voyage into the world of game development. It's our team of university graduates' pride and joy, the result of two years of hard graft, and we really hope you enjoy and appreciate it!<br><br>Dungeon No Dungeon is a turn-based roguelike game with a unique hand-drawn art style, with a strategy system based around body parts that you've likely never encountered before. Building on its individual art style and strategy system, we've worked in roguelike elements and all sorts of weird and wonderful random encounters, not to mention the Lovecraftian elements to ramp up the thrill. Aside from this, the game was first conceptualized as a board game. As time went on, we fell in love with the idea of creating a video game of our own, and so decided to make it into the Dungeon No Dungeon of today.<br><br>As we've never made a game before, we've encountered our fair share of difficulty and challenges. It's knocked us to our feet many a time, yet we keep getting back up and learning as we go. Nonetheless, we've now finally managed to make it happen! If you have any questions or problems encountered while playing, we sincerely apologize and assure you that they'll be rectified as appropriate as soon as possible.<br><br><br>Wishing you all the best,<br>Larcen<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STEAM Beginners Only<\/h2><br>Seeker's Bundle<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In-game Trinkets<br>Seeker's Bundle (Necklace and ring)<br><\/li><li>In-game Currency<br>300 Gold (Used to purchase characters or items)<br><\/li><li>In-game Resource<br>30 Magic Crystals (Used to upgrade skills)<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STEAM Beginners Only<\/h2><br>Seeker's Bundle<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>In-game Trinkets<br>Seeker's Bundle (Necklace and ring)<br><\/li><li>In-game Currency<br>300 Gold (Used to purchase characters or items)<br><\/li><li>In-game Resource<br>30 Magic Crystals (Used to upgrade skills)<\/li><\/ul>","short_description":"Dungeon No Dungeon is a turn-based roguelike game with a unique hand-drawn art style, with a strategy system based around body parts that you've likely never encountered before.","fullgame":{"appid":"1251210","name":"Dungeon No Dungeon"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong>, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese<br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“This is a turn-based Roguelike maze exploration game. The Roguelike part of the game is more traditional, but where it shines is in the core combat system. Each part of the character's body in the game has its own armor and health, attacking different parts will get different effects, but the corresponding hit rate is also different, can be said to be high risk and high profit. At the same time, the character's skill design is also very good, very RPG feel.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/id\/zuoai\/recommended\/1251210\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >向日葵游戏<\/a><br><br>“A roguelike game that has potential but still needs polishing.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/club.sonkwo.com\/posts\/430737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >杉果游戏社区<\/a><br><br>“Overall, the game experience is pretty good, and it can be expected to continue in the future. Developers are also maintaining constant updates and polishing, looking forward to more characters and maps, as well as various elements of diverse gameplay. The sound effects and dubbing of the game are okay. Listening and playing has an experience that is not a dungeon better than a dungeon.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561199004466485\/recommended\/1251210\/\" target=\"_blank\"
