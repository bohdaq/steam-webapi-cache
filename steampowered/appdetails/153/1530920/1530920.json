Out of the 1,156 U-Boats which were commissioned, 765 never returned to port.

We are also being advised by one of the last men still alive who served on a U-Boat, Mr. Friedrich Grade, chief-engineer on U-96 and U-183. Even further, we have a partnership with the ‘Freundeskreis U-995’, whose sole purpose is to restore and maintain the last Type VII-C in existence.

We are giving the countless other ships and planes you will encounter a similar treatment. All of the units you will encounter in this project are one-to-one translations of the original blueprints and building regulations, built with the utmost attention to detail. To make it function realistically as well, we are developing a level of physics simulation that takes into account things such as hydrostatic pressure, viscous resistance, electrical conductivity, propagation of sound through different mediums, salinity, temperature, Boyle’s law, and many, and many more factors.

We are not deliberately trying to scare people away by making something so complicated that you will need to get a Ph.D. in submarining first just to enjoy Crush Depth. You will find interactive tutorials that will teach you everything you need to know: from complex interactions between the engine management, ballast system, and rudder controls needed to dive the boat properly, to how to decode and encode radio traffic with the enigma machine, to making a tasty <i>Eintopf <\/i>for your crewmates.<br><br>Apart from that, you will be able to customize your experience to suit just how complicated you want things to be.

Even further, you can forego having to do that at all, by letting the intelligent AI take control of whatever task you have in mind.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The World of Crush Depth<\/h2>Crush Depth will offer you a variety of settings. Our main focus for the further development of this project is creating a persistent MMO-environment, set in and around the U-Boat base of Lorient, France. From there, you and your crew members will depart for the Atlantic and other parts of the world. Apart from the patrols themselves, the project will also spend a great deal of attention on life onshore, from repairing and restocking your boat, preparing and planning for your next departure, coordinating radio traffic with those currently at sea, to having a drink or two (or three, or four, or five) with your fellow sailors in the local bar.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1530920\/extras\/b.jpg?t=1644711470\" \/><br><br>Apart from all the valves, dials, and other machinery, you will be able to interact with, other items you find onboard or bring on your person will be fully interactive as well. This will allow you to engage in dozens of other activities, such as playing a game of chess or skat with your crewmates, having a cup of coffee, or trying to nick your captain’s pair of binoculars (The latter is probably ill-advised, but we feel we shouldn’t ignore the lighter side of life on board either). <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1530920\/extras\/light_side.jpg?t=1644711470\" \/><br><br>Your own player character will also be fully customizable to your own liking, offering a wide range of options in terms of physique, clothing, accessories, and the like.

Other options will include historical encounters, where you will be put in the exact same time and spot as some of the real skippers were. Customizable encounters, where you can decide for yourself what kind of ships you wish to encounter, where, when, and under which conditions. Interactive training missions, that will allow you to dot the i’s and cross the t’s before you decide it’s time to get in the thick of it. All of these modes are fully networked as well, ready for you to have at alone, or with a group of friends. <br><br>Even more, if you would rather play on the allied side, why not? This is something we hope to expand on in later versions of the project, but a playable Elco PT-Boat (and perhaps some other units as well), will be included in a first release.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1530920\/extras\/g.jpg?t=1644711470\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support our project!<\/h2>Your contributions make a big difference to our project.
