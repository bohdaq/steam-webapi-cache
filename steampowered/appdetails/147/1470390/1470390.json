It's everywhere in the City of Beats. Music drives absolutely everything in this rogue-lite, twin-stick shooter. Listen to the beat, get into the flow, and unleash bullet hell on the rooftops of the City, blasting through legions of hostile robots.<br><br>Don't worry about the damage. Humans left a while ago, and it's just us androids up here. Well, androids and robots, controlled by an ornery rogue A.I., the Zeitgeber, trying to impose its own groove on all robo-kind.
