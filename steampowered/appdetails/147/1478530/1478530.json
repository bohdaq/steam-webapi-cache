Call Me Under takes place in the mysterious underwater city of Styx, a haven inhabited by humans, sirens, and a host of unknown otherworldly entities. <br><br>Play as a choice of two different faceless protagonists from The Surface seeking to leave their past behind and start fresh in a new city, even if it is one only rumored to exist at the bottom of the ocean. They do say there's nothing like a clean slate...<br><br>But maybe not if you find yourself thrown into the middle of a brewing fight between the Shadows and the Light; two ancient, otherworldly entities embroiled in a centuries-long battle for power. <br><br>Our two demos are a very early example of what you will see in the final game, with many elements and features still a work in progress. We created this preview with the intent of introducing you to the characters and giving you a peek into the world of Styx, and we look forward to bringing you an incredible game when completed!

I am dying to find out more about its world and characters — both of which are teeming with beauty to behold and secrets to unravel. the writing is poetic, almost lyrical at times. It manages to seamlessly blend horror and darkness with a gorgeous, seductive cast and extensive lore.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.fanbyte.com\/news\/call-me-under-the-upcoming-1950s-underwater-mystery-dazzles-with-new-demo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fanbyte<\/a><br><br>“Call Me Under has more than enough intrigue to and adventure to keep you interested, with a star-studded cast , including voices from Allegra Clarke and Robbie Daymond.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/gaymingmag.com\/2020\/11\/call-me-under-an-lgbt-1950s-visual-novel-revealed-on-kickstarter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gayming Magazine<\/a><br><br>“There’s just something about a 1950s fantasy noir thriller that sits so right; the aesthetic, the characters, the grey cement that accompanies city-life; and it all comes together wonderfully under the ocean in Lunaris Games’ Call Me Under. Reminiscent of 2K’s Bioshock, the underwater motif omits an eerie setting and coupled with the supernatural, the mysteries are thrilling, to say the least. Call Me Under looks to be something special.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.switchaboo.com\/kickstarter-project-of-the-week-call-me-under\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Switchaboo<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1478530\/header.jpg?t=1614881629","website":"https:\/\/www.lunarisgames.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Window XP+<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1 GHz Intel or AMD Processor<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DirectX or OpenGL compatible card<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 100 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows Vista or above<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS X 10.6 or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1 GhzCore 2 Duo<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DirectX or OpenGL compatible card<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 100 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS X 10.7 or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copyright © 2021 by Lunaris Games<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll rights reserved.
