Born into a life of persecution, they fled to the countryside with their mother, Madeleine, accused by witch hunters of birthing demons. When the trio was finally caught, the children were forced to watch their mother burn before being sold to a mysterious group clad in black cloaks. Prisoners to the cult, they took part in unusual experiments, their animosity towards humanity growing each day. The pair eventually fled, in the process burning the cult’s temple to the ground. Though Charlotte ran to the safety of a nearby forest, her brother—still affixed to her body—died in the escape.<br><br>For years to come, Charlotte skulked through the alleys and sewers of France, stealing and finding shelter where she could, avoiding the black cloaks at all cost. She made sure to tend to the corpse of her rotting brother, seeing him as her only remaining family. During a frigid winter, Charlotte, weakened and starving, realized her time was coming to an end. As she gave into the comfort of death, a vicious shriek pierced her ears. Impossibly, Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, spilling to the ground in a bloody puddle.
