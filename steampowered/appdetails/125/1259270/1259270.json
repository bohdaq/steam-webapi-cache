The tooltips where later extended even further by adding a jet stat sheet to the intermission, showing how all your jet stats are currently affected by items.

Many of the items explore new mechanics or make better use of previously established ones. The update also finally added an unlock menu to the game. This &quot;data cloud&quot; is accessible from the pause menu and shows unlock conditions, tooltips and descriptions of all the gear in the game. Jets and zones also got completely new entries there. The End-Tech update again featured many quality of life tweaks and bug fixes and also came with some minor visual additions in the form of a new hitspark system.","about_the_game":"The Deck Crew Edition DLC is a way for people who want to further support the development of the game by voluntarily paying a couple more bucks.
