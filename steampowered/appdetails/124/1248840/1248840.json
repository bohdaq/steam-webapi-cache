It swings between life and death, classic genre convention and thoughtful subversion, the mind-bendingly global and the heartbreakingly personal. It holds its own against giants of science fiction by refusing to be pinned down, floating between genre and tone with the unknowable elegance of flight. It’s tragic and triumphant, a vision of the narrative work games could do without the frivolous constraints that tie them to convention. Like the island itself, Sephonie layers metaphors to build a distant vision of a tragic and hopeful future.”<br>10\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.gamepur.com\/reviews\/sephonie-diagnoses-the-heart-of-how-platformers-make-meaning-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamepur<\/a><br><br>“It excels as both a platformer and a puzzle game, but what makes Sephonie a Game of the Year contender... is how its mastery of familiar gameplay tropes ties into one of the best video game stories ever created.”<br>10\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/gaming\/sephonie-review-pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Inverse<\/a><br><br>“Sephonie is an incredible masterclass in proving that the 3D Platformer genre still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4cTV3z3-Kwc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >YourFriendJacob<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1248840\/header.jpg?t=1649961869","website":"https:\/\/analgesic.productions\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 64-bit Dual-core 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 3 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce 610M<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 10.14.6<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual-core 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 3 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel Iris Pro 1536 MINIMUM (late 2013 MacBook Pro - lower WILL NOT RUN.)<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 10.15<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual-core 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 3 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> 2014 MacBook Pro or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 64-BIT ONLY, Most recent Ubuntu or SteamOS only<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual-core 2.5 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 3 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce 610M or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Any<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> We offer no support to other distros.
