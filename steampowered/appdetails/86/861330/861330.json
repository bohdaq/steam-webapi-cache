If you are into Into The Breach style games and you wanted that with a crossover of Mutant League or Blood Bowl, that's kind of what this game excels at. [...] It's got progression, it's got unlocks, it's got all those Roguelike mechanics on in there. The sound design is good, I love the soundtrack. [...] I love the character design. I think everything looks really, really rad. I don't really have any complaints about the game. It seems to be a game that is designed very, very well from the top to the bottom.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sCocvP-tmtg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"
