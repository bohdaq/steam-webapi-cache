Between missions, you make dialogue choices in conversations with your team and your rivals, piece together the plot on a conspiracy map, choose how to upgrade each wizard's spells, and unlock new outfits by building the confidence to wear them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou'll be fighting a paramilitary corp whose elite magical operatives include the Less Lethal Pyromancer, a religious regime who oppress resistance with Riot Priests, the elder Shrublords of the Druid Mafia, and the Rushwater Police Department's rising star: The Traffic Warlock.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe expect the core campaign to take about 8 hours to complete, with some optional side missions that are more about challenge than story.","about_the_game":"Tactical Breach Wizards is a puzzle tactics game where you lead a team of outcast witches and wizards in kevlar, unravelling a modern geopolitical conspiracy by combining your spells in clever ways, dealing with your emotional problems, and knocking people through windows.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe want to encourage you to find novel and ridiculous ways to use your spells, so we allow you to rewind your turn as many times as you like, letting you freely experiment with any wild idea you might have - until you find one just stupid enough to work.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe campaign is story driven and linear, and each of your team is a named character with entirely unique abilities.
