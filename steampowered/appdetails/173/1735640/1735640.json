Each crop type has a different value.  Be careful though.  If you do not get your harvested crops to market in time, they will go bad and you will not collect a profit.  After each round of 1 minute, 2 minutes, or 3 minutes, depending on the amount of money you have saved in the bank, you will have the option to upgrade your tractor model, drive speed, harvest time, and harvest regrowth.
