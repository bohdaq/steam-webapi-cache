We're happy to have you! Explore an interactive exhibition of meticulously recreated lockpicking minigames from throughout video game history.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“The Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking is a playable exhibition of a common gaming interaction and, well, it's an experience like visiting the Derwent Pencil Museum. Before you go in you're thinking pencils are the most boring thing on Earth, let's get this over with, then you come out toting a gift shop bag ready to fight anyone who dares besmirch one of humanity's greatest tools… if you enjoy seeing the evolution of something apparently simple laid out, thinking about why it is the way it is, and just fiddling with different minigames trying to 'recreate' the same thing, this is a bitesized, interesting and well-curated experience.”<br><a
