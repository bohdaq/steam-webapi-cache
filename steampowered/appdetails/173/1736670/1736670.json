It is a lot of fun. ... In the case of Tilting Tiles, the game is a near perfect budget friendly puzzle game that is an absolute must play.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dGYtSwcFKdU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Indie Gaming Guild<\/a><br><br>“TreeFall set out to do one thing only with Tilting Titles—make an entertaining puzzle game with a simple premise. Although I do have a problem with the control scheme, it doesn’t detract from the well-constructed puzzles that have a nice flow. This one has no moral concerns to speak of so it should be safe for anyone to play. If puzzles are your thing, Tilting Tiles is worth the purchase for the 58 puzzles it offers.”<br>8\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.christcenteredgamer.com\/reviews\/pc-mac\/7915-tilting-tiles-pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Christ Centered Gamer<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1736670\/header.jpg?t=1638807606","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7+<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 3 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 6 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 3 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copyright TreeFall Studios L.L.C.","developers":["TreeFall Studios L.L.C."],"publishers":["TreeFall Studios L.L.C."],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":9900,"final":9900,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"99₴"},"packages":[622098],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Tilting Tiles","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":622098,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Tilting Tiles -
