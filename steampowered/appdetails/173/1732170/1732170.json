Seqitaire combines math, pattern-searching, and card-draw mechanics of Solitaire to bring you a fresh math gaming experience.<br><br>Add, subtract, multiply, or divide using number tiles in a tile grid to produce the specified number. Be wary of what tiles you select though, as each tile is associated with a suit: diamonds, clubs, hearts, spades, or wild. Cards drawn from a deck determine the target number and other criteria for math submissions. For example, in addition to outputting the number 2, the tiles submitted may need to be all of the hearts suit, use at least one multiplication operator, or be submitted by swiping only. Cards become earned after submitting all of the number results for the given card. Earn all of the cards in the deck to win the game!<br><br>How is Seqitaire like Solitaire? Just as card stacks in Solitaire must alternate between black and red suits and must be ordered in numerical sequence, certain cards in Seqitaire require selected tiles to alternate between black and red suits, or form a &quot;Run&quot; where the number tiles must be able to be rearranged in consecutive numerical order. Every game of Seqitaire is unique since all the tiles are generated randomly, giving the game high replay value. Like Solitaire, not every level is beatable on the first try, and your success depends partially on skill and partially on the tiles available. The tiles disappear after being used, so the challenge is to maximize points by using as many tiles as possible in number submissions, while still being able to earn all of the cards with the tiles available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features:<\/strong><\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single-player<br><\/li><li>10 individually crafted levels (more coming soon!)<br><\/li><li>Submit math equations by tapping or swiping to connect tiles in a tile grid<br><\/li><li>12 unique card conditions for varied game play<br><\/li><li>Single and multiple card draw from card deck<br><\/li><li>Partial keyboard support<\/li><\/ul><br>Seqitaire is a great math game for adults looking to train their brain or children learning arithmetic. Most new players are able to learn to play Seqitaire quickly without completing the game tutorial, so do not be daunted by the appearance of complex rules.
