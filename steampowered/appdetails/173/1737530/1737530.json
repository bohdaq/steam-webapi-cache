Defend Louisiana with your occult raven: shoot, dash, stun, bullet time to defeat hordes of monsters. They stole your child, get him back. Want to play with a friend? Coop is in the works!","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong>, French<br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“DarkTimes is very different as it is a much slower experience, taking in that horror atmosphere that I found interesting. Instead of having 20 to 30 enemies coming at Annie, it was more like 10 at the max trying to use everything at my disposal because I needed to reload after every seven shots. It made me play more tactically than I was used to with this type of game.”<br><a
