The procedural generation means each star system consists of anywhere between one and a dozen planets, with their temperature, mass, atmospheric conditions all determined by their proximity to their star (or stars).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Harvest<\/h2>Harvest planetary samples by building and deploying probes. Probes gather samples of the planet's raw materials. Every star system has a different makeup of minerals, gases and chemicals - each of which have different strengths and weaknesses, that affect their crafting quality. Some planets are capable of supporting life, allowing players to harvest not only inorganic materials but flora and fauna from the planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Craft<\/h2>Craft better ship parts, such as engines, jump drives, power generators, and comms arrays - or use materials to build new bigger and better ships, or space stations.
