While you can't leave, you can certainly adjust your surroundings using your trusty (makeshift) time machine. However, due to certain structural limitations, your time machine can only travel backwards exactly 5 years into the past, shortly after you had been initially imprisoned. The good news is that you can travel back and forth between the past and the present, so use your powers of time-travel to collect a variety of objects, alter the course of time, and find a way to escape the room (and free yourself from your own madness).<br><br><strong>Small Changes Can Have Big Consequences<\/strong><br>By making tiny adjustments in the past, you can make some pretty substantial (and potentially horrifying) changes in the present. Leave a rotten apple in the dirt and it might grow into a beautiful tree. Or it might attract terrifying death ants. Who knows! You have nothing to lose so you might as well find out. The consequences of your actions are a problem for future-you.<br><br><strong>Be Kind To Yourself<\/strong><br>In Cordychosis, you begin the game with only one friend, a highly neurotic version of yourself from 5 years ago. Enlisting the aid of your previous self will be imperative to your progress, but earning your own cooperation may prove to be a challenge.<br><br><strong>Explore!<\/strong><br>While the possibilities of the future are endless, Cordychosis is a narrative game with one definitive ending. However, the path to reach that ending may not be a linear one. This is a game which encourages exploration and trying things out just to see what happens! You can always undo your actions later if they turn out to have horrifying consequences.
