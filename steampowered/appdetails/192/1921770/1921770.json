For example, if you use only a few Plot Points, the manga volume will have an Ordinary Arc... However, if you use more, then the manga volume will have a Highlight Arc.<br>Occasionally you might link three weeks' atmospheres in a particular order, and your manga will change to become even better.<br><br>Increase your manga artist stats, and keep an eye on the use of your Plot Points!<br><br>▼About Manga Artist Rank<br>As you sell more manga volumes, you will be acknowledged and your manga artist rank will increase.<br><br>As your manga artist rank increases you will be able to buy more things in the shop.
