Server Owner Tycoon lets you bring your vision to life. Choose your host, pick your server specifications, and connect to the internet to get started. As you build your online empire, choose what game features are best for your server, configure each feature to please your userbase, choose visual content that pairs well with your theme, and manage your server resources to ensure your players keep playing.
