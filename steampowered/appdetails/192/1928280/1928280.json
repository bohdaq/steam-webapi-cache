Geisha Girls is a visual novel targeted towards those who enjoy the company of girls as love interests. <br \/>\r\nThe game is filled with humor and references to otaku culture, ranging from “Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure” to the more recent “Azur Lane”. Taking place in Nippon (referring to a trope-filled version of Japan), the game heavily relies on stereotypes of Japan as seen from an otaku perspective, the depiction of anime girls, and the concept of “waifu.”<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStory:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe protagonist, an otaku who grew up in the United States and has a thing for samurai, enrolls at Fujiyama High, a prestigious school known for churning out the best freshly-baked samurai.<br \/>\r\nFor plot purposes, the protagonist, who has now become a special scholarship student at Fujiyama High, is subject to one questionable condition: if he fails to earn the trust of his fellow students in just one week, he must perform the infamous HARAKIRI!<br \/>\r\nThe protagonist starts a group called Shinsengumi and starts creating bonds of trust with the girls at the school.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFeatures:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n・Dress-up: Each character has different outfits starting from the beginning of the game.

Once the player sets a breast size, they will be able to see their pick reflected in the game's story mode.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n・Japanese voices: Although not fully dubbed, the game comes with Japanese voices! Every girl has her own personality, and her “voice patterns” pop up in certain situations. (e.g. “Thank you!” after receiving a present, “You’ll make me blush!!” after receiving a compliment, etc.) <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n・In-game animations: The girls are animated, so they move both on the main screen and while reading the story. Facial expressions, moving hips &amp; shoulders, etc. - all you need to feel the dating experience!","about_the_game":"Harakiri!
