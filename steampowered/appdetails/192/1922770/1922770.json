The object of the game is to kill or (threaten with inescapable capture) of the opponent's president. The other way to win is to eliminate all of your opponent pieces leaving the president the only piece standing. This would be called torturing your opponent soul which would be the worst way to lose (GAME OVER). There is NO quitting in American Catur, NO playing for a draw , NO playing for a stalemate in a American Catur. We treat you with a victory ever game! WITH NO tie's if your skillful enough to win. There is nothing quite like the feeling of victory. When we win at something, our body shoots us with dopamine.<br \/>\r\n <br \/>\r\nLike Bobby Fischer was looking to better the game. This game offers skill and luck perfected by technical experts. A new game was born with the principles of controlling each piece mirroring modern day warfare. American catur has a marginally different rule than chess making it even more challenging to play. The addition of combining squares and triangles spaces to the board that supports twice the number of pieces than chess. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI want to keep the old catur\/chess flavor and add a new savor making it a really interesting type of strategic game. So, we added bombs to the equation. Four different types of bombs used for offensive and defensive aids. These are bombs that are placed on outside perimeter of the board (The inner perimeter is for triangle spaces and the outer perimeter is for the square spaces), With these four types of bombs (Poison &amp; Atomic for triangle spaces, Hydrogen &amp; Biological for the square spaces.) The nuclear bombs kill the piece(s) it lands on and cannot return back to the game and the chemical bombs capture any piece(s) it lands on and becomes a POW. These bombs are cocked and loaded and ready to be launched and guided by the roll of the dice. So, with all these new ideas we made sure that the game didn’t degenerate down to memorization and prearrangement like chess is today. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are only two pieces that remove bombs one is the Navy that removes the bombs by jumping over it on the square space and the other the coast guard that removes bombs by jumping over it on the triangle spaces. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnother challenge is to have your Coast Guard who can travel forward and backward and side to side go down to the other side of the board and rescue any captured Prisoner of war (POW). No limit on how many times you can rescue. Coast Guards pieces do not get promoted like chess.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore people will be acknowledged, invited and playing because the game is very exciting to battle the (six-star) General of Armies War Machine. The league will be coming soon once we establish a demand for our world community and world support organization. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nKeep a lookout for sign-up.
