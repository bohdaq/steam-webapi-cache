The Backrooms are out of the boundaries of the real world and can only be accessed by no-clipping through a floor, elevator, wall, stairs, etc., in a place that inspires deja vu or an uncomfortable feeling of nostalgia. Explore the liminal spaces, survive the entities, scavenge for food, supplies, and weapons, craft items to trade, and try to survive. There is a No Gore mode as well as a no entities mode to allow you to play the experience you seek. We have tried to recreate all of your favorite levels: The Main 9, Level Run for your life, Level 188, The Terror Hotel, Level Fun, The Snackrooms, The Poolrooms, The Sh4dy Gr3y, Kitty's House, The End and so much more. There are mini-games like The Terror Hotel Casino, Skin or No Skin, Backrooms Brawl, Ski Ball, General StarFlares Laser Game, The Charleston Button, Basketball, Squirt Gun Madness, Backrooms Fruit Finale, Music Sequencer, and many more. These levels are complete with bases, outposts, communities, pawn shops, breweries, museums, farmer's markets, and crafting\/upgrade workshops. There are also 50+ in-game achievements to accomplish giving you hours of playability. <strong>Please note that this game is in <u>Early Access<\/u> so please leave reviews accordingly. Bugs and general jank should be expected and we may have to wipe data at times. We are very responsive developers and would love to have you on our Discord to help shape the game and work out any issues you may be having.
