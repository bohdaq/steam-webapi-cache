Arriving in Eyre City after a hasty escape you find yourself work as a driver for the less-than-reputable Moonwave Cruiser Company. Around town the Company is known for its discretion in return for good pay. Question is can you survive in the City without falling back into the world you just escaped, or will the reapers of the past come back to finish you off?<br><br>Each night you patrol the mean streets of the latest in Australia's Megacities, a place where life is expensive and failure means being thrown to the wastes beyond the walls. Calls come in, scarce details about who you are helping and why are given and it's up to you to either take the contract or to decline. Either option will affect your standing with multiple of the game's characters as well as your own organisation, Moonwave doesn't want drivers that never take a contract after all. Your contact rarely gives you more than a time and a place, and it's up to you to get there and get out as quickly and efficiently as possible, the quicker the job the better the pay. This means learning the trench-like streets of Eyre City, it's suburbs and major attractions to help you get from A to B without running around in circles.<br><br>As the sun rises over the Eyre your working day comes to an end. The company cut is taken from your earnings and you better hope you took enough contracts to cover the expenses of life within the walls. Our nocturnal hero goes to rest for now, as the fallout of who they helped and didn't help ripples through the city. A reputation cuts both ways in Eyre City, it helps gain access to more lucrative jobs but could also lead to trouble from any number of people who may come to want you off the streets.<br><br>Moonwave Overdrive is a game about maintaining balance in a neon-lit whirlpool trying to pull you off track. Balance your reputation and standing with multiple characters, balance your finances to stay in the game and balance the kind of contracts you take to get you these things. See the sights of Eyre City, expand your fleet of cruisers and upgrade the ones you already have. Find a way to thrive in between the conflicts of the Megapolis' power players and find a way to survive the demands of the city.
