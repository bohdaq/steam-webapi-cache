You can choose 1 being card from your deck that you can play at any time if you have the resources. This card is revealed at all times to give your opponent the ability for counterplay. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/HeroicBeing.gif?t=1658257296\" \/><br><br>Consistency is the name of the game in Destiny's Divide, while all games and game modes feel unique and satisfying, we still want your deck to do what you built it for, Heroic Being is an example of how we are achieving this. Together with the constant 1 energy gain per turn and adding specific cards to the SharedBoard, you will be able to play your deck the way you built it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sharedboard<\/h2><br>Sharedboard is a two sided sword, it brings consistency but it also brings chaos. When building a deck each player appoints 3 cards to the shared board. 4 of the 6 cards(2 are banned) will then be put into the Sharedboard and revealed to both players. Both players can play the cards at any time during the game if they have the resources. This means you can play the cards your opponent places in the Sharedboard and they can play the ones you did. Choose carefully on what you are willing to give!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/Sharedboard.gif?t=1658257296\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Transcendent abilities and avoiding pay to win.<\/h2><br>Transcendent abilities: These are card abilities that can appear on any card of Legendary or Transcendent rarity; either being, aura or spell. They are marked with red colour on the cards. They are extremely powerful, such as “Refresh” that enables your hero ability(can only be used once per game otherwise) to be used again. <br><br>Transcendent cards have 2 of these abilities that are selected at random. There are a total of 7 transcendent abilities, which makes a lot of different combinations of the same card. These cards will only be obtainable by playing the game as rewards or by crafting. They will not be available from purchasable packs.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/TRabilities.png?t=1658257296\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Trading and Borrowing:<\/strong><\/h2><br>As this is a trading collectible card game, we will allow players to trade and borrow cards between each other. We think this is one of the main features that is part of the card game experience and it is missing in the online world far too often.<br><br>We have added a few restrictions to prevent card selling or abuse of the system. Our goal is to have an experience that is as authentic as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trading:<\/h2><br>Players will be allowed to trade any cards in their collection that are not starter cards (initial free deck). With some limitations to prevent card selling etc. One of the limitations is 2 trades per day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Borrowing\/Lending:<\/h2><br>You can lend any of your cards to your friends for a limited amount of time. You can simply send the card to them, set the duration and the card will automatically return to you once the set time expires. There are several restrictions in place to prevent any abuse of the system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game modes:<\/strong><\/h2><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/MatarHeroPower.gif?t=1658257296\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Casual:<\/h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Normal and AI<\/h2><br>You can play versus random people or AI and test your decks, or just play whenever you don't want the pressure of a ranked game. This is our casual mode; due to its nature it will yield the least rewards for players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ranked Game Modes:<\/h2><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/Divine.gif?t=1658257296\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Constructed <\/h2><br>Here you will play versus opponents of your skill level. You will then be ranked on the ladder and try to climb ranks with the ELO ranking system. At the end of each month, you will receive rewards based on the amount of games you played and your current rank.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Brawl <\/h2>In this game mode you will be able to select from all available cards even if you don't own them. You will receive selections of 4 cards 45 times in a row and build your deck. Then you will be matched against players with the same amount of wins as you.<br><br>The more wins you get the better the rewards will be. As soon as you lose your 3rd game, the brawl will end. If you can manage to win 15 times before losing 3 times (winning the brawl), you will receive the best rewards and be automatically entered into the ladder.<br>The ladder will rank players based on how many times you managed to win the brawl.<br><br>There are some unique features in the brawl such as rerolling your given choices, to better tailor your decks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Hardcore <\/h2><br>In this game mode you will play with your constructed decks, all cards are allowed and there are not any other restrictions to what cards you can use apart from standard rules of the game. Once you enter the game mode and select your deck (which will lock the cards until you complete the game mode), you play until you lose. You will be playing versus progressively harder opponents (with the same wins as you). You can also at any time after a match choose to end the run and unlock your deck again.<br><br>The main feature of the hardcore mode is that when you win you get 3 of your opponent's cards permanently and they lose those same cards permanently. <br>However if you lose the exact opposite happens and 3 of your cards are transferred to your opponent permanently.<br><br>The more you win the better cards you win\/lose. For example If you have 0 wins and you win\/lose, you will only gain\/drop common cards, if you have 6 wins and you win\/lose, you will gain\/drop Heroic cards. Each game after 10 wins you will drop\/gain at least one transcendent card(if it is present in both decks). <br>You can only win or lose cards of a quality that is present in your deck. <br><br>For example, if you create a deck of only common cards, you reach a 10 win streak, you play versus a player who has 2 transcendent cards in his deck and win, you will still only receive common cards from them as you can't win cards of a higher quality that exist in your deck.<br><br>The same goes for losing, if you lose versus a “common” deck, you will only lose common cards regardless of you win streak.<br>This game mode will bring a interesting dynamic to the game, will you play your best cards, increase your chances of success but risk losing them, or will you use common cards, lower your chances and try to hunt the win streak rewards?<br><br>As other two game modes (Constructed Ranked and Brawl) so will the hardcore ranked game mode receive rewards at the end of the ranked season, the rewards will include normal packs, special packs, titles, card crafting currency and other goodies all specific for their respective game mode. <br><br>The end of the season rewards will also include better rewards such as unique packs. (also specific to the game mode - eg. all hardcore top players will receive a separate unique transcendent card(brawl and constructed ranked top 10 will receive another unique) only for top 10 hardcore players), while lower ranks will receive either legendary, heroic or epic unique.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/EldorHeroPower.gif?t=1658257296\" \/>","about_the_game":"<a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/discord.gg\/destinysdivide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1553390\/extras\/Discord1.gif?t=1658257296\" \/><\/a><br><br>Free Hardcore PvP Fantasy Card Game with progression and reward system made for competitive card game players.
