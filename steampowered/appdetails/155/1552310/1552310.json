The feel of the visuals is so nostalgic and brings back many memories from the old days. It brings memories back from the time when you were playing a game on a tiny screen or in an arcade with your friends. The game they made is not just a good horror experience, but a reminder, a time machine.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.lawod.com\/janitor-bleeds-lawod-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >LAWOD<\/a><br><br>“It's starting to feel more novel when a new horror game doesn't sport retro PS1-style visuals, but Janitor Bleeds still manages to stand out.
