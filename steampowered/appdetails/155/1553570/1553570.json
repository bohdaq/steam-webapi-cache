Otherwise, it will disappear if there's no mine around it, or show a number represents how many mines are around.<br \/>\r\nYour target is to uncover all the sphere that doesn't contain a mine, while keep those with mines covered. Once you found a sphere contains a mine, mark it. After marking enough mines around a discovered number, you can safely uncover other spheres around.

An experienced player can mark all the mines in a 10-mine game under 5 secs when playing the 2D version, but it's really hard to complete an 8-mine game in 5 mins playing the 3D version.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you really think you're an expert, the expert mode is here for you! Try it and move with caution.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Mine Sweeper 3D game is made with Unreal Engine4, which provides epic graphics and full screen experience. You are playing the minesweeper game in a mountain area, with a house and a camp besides. Feel free to travel around, and back to game at whenever you want! You can also take a walk after winning a game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHave Fun!","about_the_game":"A 3D version of the classic game Mine Sweeper.<br \/>\r\nA huge cube of spheres appears in the sky, and some of them contains mine.
