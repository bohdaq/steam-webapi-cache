{"1550330":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"POLY SYNTH GUNNER","steam_appid":1550330,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"POLY SYNTH GUNNER is an arcade-style first person shooter with an endless wave of enemies that scales indefinitely. Action is high-paced and will require you to be constantly moving as different enemies will charging at you, shooting projectiles, and more. The longer you survive, the harder the game will get as enemies will do more damage, spawn at a faster rate, and cover the map with projectiles in a bullet hell-like manner. To survive, you are equipped with a variety of different weapons and abilities that will help you stay alive. As you kill enemies, you will earn points that can be used to upgrade your weapons and abilities on-the-go. The gameplay is entirely instance-based meaning progression is not carried over. Points are not carried over so don't be ashamed to spend your points unabashedly. Upgrades are not carried over. Death is death. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou can choose to be a jack of all trades and upgrade your weapons and abilities equally. Alternatively, you can choose to specialize on one ability and one weapon. Play the game the way you want to play it. Currently, the game has three different weapons: machine gun, electric shotgun, and grenade launcher. Each weapon has their own intended initial purpose depending on the situation of focusing on a single target or multiple enemies. As you upgrade each weapon, you may find that they diverge from their initial purpose. There are also three different abilities: power, shield, and summon. When the Power ability is activated, you will temporarily dual wield your weapons with unlimited ammo and regain health per kill. The Shield ability provides you with a shield buff and increases your base speed. The Summon Ability allows you to summon little astronauts that will follow you wherever you go and protect you.","about_the_game":"POLY SYNTH GUNNER is an arcade-style first person shooter with an endless wave of enemies that scales indefinitely.
