This versatile, secure, and affordable software solution makes working across multiple computers a breeze.<br><br>If you are on the go and remoting into other PCs, or simply require the power of a seamless connection of up to 9 machines, Multiplicity KVM is the best application to get the job done. You can lock and unlock all of your PCs at once from one keyboard, listen to audio from multiple PCs without having to switch headsets and speakers, and drag and drop files and folders of any size between PCs.<br><br>Creatives love the ability to retain their formatting when they use Multiplicity KVM to seamlessly copy and paste content from one PC to another.
