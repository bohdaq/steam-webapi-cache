I [played] Game Revenant's inaugural indie title from start to finish and I loved every minute of it. If you [...] have even a passing affection for puzzle games, you should definitely pick it up - no doubt about it.”<br>8\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/techraptor.net\/gaming\/reviews\/where-shadows-slumber-review-colorful-cliffs-dark-depths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TechRaptor<\/a><br><br>“Where Shadows Slumber is great.
