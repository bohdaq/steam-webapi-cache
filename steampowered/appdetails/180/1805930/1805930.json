I don’t think they could make it better if they tried. It’s a perfectly succinct and full horror tale unlike any other.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.dreadxp.com\/ultra-indie-spotlight\/ultra-indie-spotlight-sunday-pumpkin-eater\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >DreadXP<\/a><br><br>“The narrative is so riveting that it really pulls you in. The hand drawn visuals are fairly simple, but effective and the descriptions of the son’s decomposing body are both medically accurate and horrifying.
