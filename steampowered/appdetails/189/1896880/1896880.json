Gameplay has been compared to a dungeon crawler, but this is really a puzzle game with swords ‘n’ sorcery set dressing.”<br>80% – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.nintendolife.com\/reviews\/switch-eshop\/dungeons-of-dreadrock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >nintendolife<\/a><br><br>“Fascinating from the first screen, immediately inserting us into its mechanisms within a few minutes of starting, just like a Zelda of the past.”<br>82% – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/multiplayer.it\/recensioni\/dungeons-of-dreadrock-recensione.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >multiplayer<\/a><br><br>“Dungeons of Dreadrock is a bite-sized game that I’m sure would work perfectly as a bit of entertainment while waiting for a bus or train on its native mobile platform. However, it’s also great on the PC version as something to gently work out your brain while enjoying the fun narrative and very vibrant pixel-art graphics. This innovative puzzler combines clever yet accessible puzzles with a dash of humour to create a very enjoyable experience.”<br>80% – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.heypoorplayer.com\/tag\/dungeons-of-dreadrock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >heypoorplayer<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/header.jpg?t=1657201524","website":"https:\/\/dungeons-of-dreadrock.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2,6 GHz Dual Core<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> I5 4 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Prof. Dr. Christoph Minnameier"],"publishers":["Prof. Dr. Christoph Minnameier"],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":9900,"final":9900,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"99₴"},"packages":[683203],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Dungeons of Dreadrock","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":683203,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Dungeons of Dreadrock - 99₴","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":9900}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"4","description":"Casual"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_152e17fe94f904b1adca625b0def913e07736721.600x338.jpg?t=1657201524","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_152e17fe94f904b1adca625b0def913e07736721.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657201524"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_800ebc047bf36d4df1a455b95509ff45d603dac7.600x338.jpg?t=1657201524","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_800ebc047bf36d4df1a455b95509ff45d603dac7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657201524"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_8637198b75e3b8e8c058e8a49d54877d23043bb2.600x338.jpg?t=1657201524","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_8637198b75e3b8e8c058e8a49d54877d23043bb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657201524"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_f8ae2093e46a45d0a1d9bb5d84a4347c81a9a858.600x338.jpg?t=1657201524","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_f8ae2093e46a45d0a1d9bb5d84a4347c81a9a858.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657201524"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_d4ec19f03aad080c2dfb6f59c159bd7d63969d6e.600x338.jpg?t=1657201524","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/ss_d4ec19f03aad080c2dfb6f59c159bd7d63969d6e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657201524"}],"movies":[{"id":256871829,"name":"Trailer","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256871829\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1643958276","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256871829\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1643958276","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256871829\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1643958276"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256871829\/movie480.mp4?t=1643958276","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256871829\/movie_max.mp4?t=1643958276"},"highlight":true}],"recommendations":{"total":105},"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"14 Mar, 2022"},"support_info":{"url":"https:\/\/dungeons-of-dreadrock.com","email":"christophminnameier@gmail.com"},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657201524","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1896880\/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1657201524","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
