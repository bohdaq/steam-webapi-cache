The planet's most mysterious nation, the isolationist Sel Tor is building a grand navy, with the seeming purpose of launching an invasion of the entire world! However, the king of the nation of Sel-Quinta has sent his herald to rally support to defeat the invasion before it starts! <br><br>This is where you come in! Taking command of a freshly formed group of six adventurers, it's up to you to travel across Sel-Quinta to rally the support of it's six major cities and halt the invasion! But Sel-Quinta's king is not the only one getting involved in this quest, and there's more going on than any of them realise...<br><br><strong>COMBAT:<\/strong> The foe isn't going down without a fight! Experience tough turn based combat featuring a large six member party and a variety of foes, from the familiar to the less familiar!  There's also a range of tough optional bosses - Ever fought a cursed excavator before? How about a pair of high speed mushrooms?<br><br><strong>STORY:<\/strong> Experience the story of the game's six party members-the out of luck All Rounder Samson, the soft hearted Thief Katalyn, the strong but silent Lysandroth, the powerful if ill tempered caster Vegal, the demonic healer Reilia and the stoic leader Hetty. And of course, the many unusual friends and foes they meet on their journey!

And perhaps, somewhere not even in the party's dimension itself! <br><br><strong>BUILDS:<\/strong> There's a lot of foes out there, but you've got the ability to respond with a variety of character setups! With over 180 skills, 150 weapons and almost 200 pieces of armour\/equipment, there's a huge range of possibility! Those mushrooms out in the delta got you down with status effects? Equip familiars to protect you! Got a foe that just won't die? Equip broaches that change the elements of your attacks or powerful elemental weapons! And for your own damage-well, how about an axe that petrifies the foe on the first swing, then smashes them for three times the damage on the second? A Scythe that outright kills non boss foes 50% of the time? How about a set of claws that strike eight times and always land a critical hit? They're all in there and more!<br><br><strong>CONVENIENCE:<\/strong> We all know RPG's sometimes have some awkward features.
