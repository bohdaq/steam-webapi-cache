As a wrestling content creator, I wanted to create a system to make the pic fed process easier and more modular. This tool attempts to evolve this traditional practice into a digital experience. This experience makes it easier, more convenient, faster, and cleaner to create wrestling pic feds than ever before.

The system is equipped to allow you to build a figure by morphing the head sculpt and adjusting the colors of the assets. You can also take this a step further by importing your own custom figure parts and custom textures.

Use this to create your own ring, printouts, stage elements, crowd panels and more. I wanted to give you a good amount of flexibility here thus, you can import your own images for many of the assets.

The setup creator allows you to build your fantasy stages or replicate real arenas. Take your custom props and place them all of the place.
