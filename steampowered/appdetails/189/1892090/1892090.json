These enormous beasts will challenge you with unique mechanics and attacks. If you want to stand a chance of taking them down, you will need to prepare well for these encounters.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1892090\/extras\/Bosses.png?t=1658434940\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LOVE LOOT?

We took elements from MMORPGs with their class system and the way they handle late game encounters by having Healer, Tanks and DPS and made a light version of this system. The player will be able to take any skills they want, but through passive abilities and the high difficulty of the game, we expect players to take on some roles on their own to tackle the difficult challenges that awaits them in the Citadel.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1892090\/extras\/RoleBase.png?t=1658434940\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CUSTOMISATION<\/h2>Prepare for your expedition by creating up to 5 loadouts.

The suits, aside from looking good, also provide the player with different starting stats, such has having more health or more speed. You can also change the suit look by selecting 2 colors. Finally, select your weapon of choice and head on in to the depths of the Citadel.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1892090\/extras\/Customisation.png?t=1658434940\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROCEDURAL GENERATION<\/h2>Procedural generations is always tricky.
