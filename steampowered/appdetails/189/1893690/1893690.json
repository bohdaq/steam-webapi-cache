Now, a newly discovered map may lead the way to a vast treasure. The path to the gold is not a safe one, and many perils await those who attempt to forge a path to the captain's hideout. Treasure hunters and thrill seekers will face threats both natural and supernatural in their quest for riches, but may also find some friends in strange places. Will they emerge victorious and resplendent with wealth, or will their avarice ultimately be their undoing?      Captain Shineheart's Gold is an adventure for 10th to 12th level characters that should take 8-10 hours to complete. While it is perfect for slotting into a pre-existing seafaring campaign, it also makes a great standalone adventure for those wanting to experience higher level play. To that end, the adventure includes a number of pre-generated characters to allow players to jump right in to the action.     <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 2 new spells <\/li><li> 3 new magic items <\/li><li> 3 new monsters <\/li><li> 7 original maps (line of sight, dynamic lighting, and animations) <\/li><li> 13 original images <\/li><li> 10 new tokens <\/li><li> 6 regenerated player characters <\/li><\/ul> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:<\/i> <strong>Fletcher Haug<\/strong>","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Captain Shineheart's Gold<\/h2>  In ages past, an orcish pirate captain is said to have defeated a dragon and taken its hoard, but neither the captain nor the gold has ever been found.
