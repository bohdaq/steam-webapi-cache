Welcome to Constructopia, the open-world survival tower-defense game where you can design, build and craft your defense! Evil Trolls have moved into your once peaceful island, and it is your task to take it back. Gather resources, craft weapons and equipment and build settlements around the island to claim your territory. Be careful, because once you place down a settlement marker, trolls will test your determination and launch an all-out attack on your newly marked settlement! Fend off waves of trolls in classic tower defense fashion, and beat the boss in the final round to create a new settlement. This challenge will test your creative skills, because in this game, you don't just place down the towers used for defence, you also have to design them in the Tower Editor! You can force your way through battles with heavy but costly artillery, or use your smarts to create complex and effective traps and towers to achieve the same effect for fewer resources. Unlock and combine tower components, let your creative energies flow and build up a defense against your enemies! A settlement can then be used to create automated resource gathering contraptions, produce building parts or research new tower components. As you take back the island from the Trolls, keep an eye out for wandering mini-bosses and small patrols. Achieving a victory over them can reward you with enchanted items, which can aid you in your future endeavors! Constructopia can be played in many different ways - we provide the building blocks for the Tower Defense game of your dreams, it is your job to make use of them in your own way!","about_the_game":"Have you ever wanted to play a Tower Defense game where you're the one designing the towers you place down?
