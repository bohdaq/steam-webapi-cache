While the game, game-play, &amp; mechanics are largely completed; it is our hope that we can expand 1) awareness, 2) add a few features, &amp; 3) expand to a few other platforms to reach a wider audience! *Note: As of Q4 2021 - we will be supporting iOS, &amp; Android. Please follow us on Social Media to learn more.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Want to save some animals, and their habitats!?\r\n\r\nRescue Bear Operation is: an introductory, 1-level, all ages, child friendly, free to play, mini game designed to create awareness around saving animals, &amp; their habitats!  We are a thought leader in Environmental Sustainability issues.  We'll be donating at least 30% of our net proceeds to charitable causes. \r\n\r\nRescue Bear is intentionally kept simple and accessible. There are two objectives.  One: save as many friendly critters as you can! Two: save as many trees by putting out the wild fires! By doing this you will accumulate points that can be used as in-game currency to purchase unique cosmetic items in game. (E.g. hats, shirts, etc) Or; if you want to help good causes in giving back to 'trusted' real world charities and organizations dedicated towards issues of climate change (e.g wildfires, flooding, etc) we also offer unique downloadable content (DLC) that can be purchased with real world currency as well. \r\n\r\nTogether - we *will* make a difference! \r\n\r\nMost of all, please have fun playing the game!\r\n\r\nThank you!","about_the_game":"Want to save some animals, and their habitats!?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRescue Bear Operation is: an introductory, 1-level, all ages, child friendly, free to play, mini game designed to create awareness around saving animals, &amp; their habitats!
