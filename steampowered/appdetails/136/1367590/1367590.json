Inspired by the original Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark series, Tormented Souls modernises with a fresh twist on the fixed perspective adventure - as Caroline Walker investigates the mysterious disappearance of twin girls in a terrifying mansion-turned-hospital.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong>, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Russian, Spanish - Latin America, Portuguese - Brazil, Italian<br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“Tormented Souls is the successor to classic survival horror. I’ve wanted a new Silent Hill (or classic Resident Evil) game for years, but I’d trade all the drama and disappointment for a fantastic spiritual successor like this any day.
