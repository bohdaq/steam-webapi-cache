Many projects have come and gone over the years but Child Arms is the most ambitious project yet.

The scope of this game alone is so large that I had to split it into 3 parts, with this game being the first. With a studio doing art and a composer on board, we are a small team trying to make an amazing game, but we can't do it without the support of a community. That is why I am working hard to make Child Arms the best game it can be and become more than just an indie game, but something far greater.<br><br>Your support is highly appreciated in this early stage of development.","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1366110\/extras\/gif_enro.gif?t=1650128242\" \/><br><br>In an alternative 16th century, where the majority of the population are youths, eight unique and diverse juvinile warriors will explore their world for the first time in human history.
