It’s a stand off, I’m outnumbered, I have an item to revive a party member, but they’re across an open door where the opposition can shoot at me. Lucking out with an enemy missing, I can rush over to my downed party member, who I instruct to aim and wait to shoot if someone moves near the opened door. One enemy moves and gets shot, takes them out, we’re at even footing now. Rushing over to my party member also put me at a perfect angle to get a good shot in, which happened to be a critical shot taking them out as well. It might have all just been luck, but there was no matching the feeling of almost being sure you’d lose, to coming up victorious.”<br>4\/5 – <a
