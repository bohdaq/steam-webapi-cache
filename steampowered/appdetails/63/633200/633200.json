A Mythlink is a type of monster that players will select when the game begins. These monsters are based on various mythological creatures (such as a dragon, Cerberus, etc.) Once players have selected a Mythlink, a special bond begins to form between the player and their new friend. This link between player and Mythlink is called a &quot;Mythlink Unity&quot;, and is so powerful that as one of you improves, so does the other. Because of this, players themselves will take part in various strength, dexterity, and brain training exercises to improve both themselves and their Mythlink.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leveling Up<\/h2>Mythlinks have 3 stats which can be improved through playing the game.
