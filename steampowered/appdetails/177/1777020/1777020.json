Parasite Slayer's main protagonist is the anti-hero Crow, a citizen who once rebelled against corruption and criminality in his city and decided to put an end to crime. Crow ends up meeting a scientist who proposes a partnership for mutual benefit. A year after the duo formed, both would face otherworldly things.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCombat: It's in third person with RPG-style camera tracking, the player can dodge enemy attacks similarly to Dark Souls and can finish off enemies when SLAY appears on top of them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOdds Percentages: The game is being programmed using a lot of variable that causes events to be random, both in combat and in the story. In combat there are chances of enemies causing greater damage to the player or vise and versa and causing different animations, besides there are also chances of transformation in enemies to more deadly stages and chance of parasites to leave inside the enemy NPC's looking for new bodies to host, or simply to escape from the Parasite Killer. The game is under development and even after completion it will receive updates that will further improve the mechanics. In the story, inspired by the mechanics of the game Undertale Resets, it can undergo changes in the dialogues and also in elements of the scenario and appearances.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSoundtrack: All the songs were also made by me: Jean Cristian Filho. You can assign them to the genres: Retro Synth Wave, Rock, Electronics, Electronic Rock, Acid Rock, Techno and Ambiente.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nInspirations: It's a mix of inspirations from science fiction movies and games. The parasites were inspired by those in the ILL game Trailer, some characters in RIck and Morty, Other creatures in Dead Space, the Thing, Alien, Stranger Things and Left 4 Dead.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAbout the location where the story takes place: I chose my country of origin, Brazil.
