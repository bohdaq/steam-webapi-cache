Repair the equipment, buy anything that can't be repaired, harvest your first crops, and you'll have the funds to continue expanding, renovating and improving.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1779610\/extras\/FarmRenovator_3.gif?t=1659079067\" \/><br><br>REPAIR<br>Locate anything that has been neglected on the farm: machines, tractors, harvesters, trailers, and any other.
