It not only matches the &quot;battle predictability&quot; strategy necessary for wargames, but also divides the deck construction into 4 (there are 4 colors of cards in the game, corresponding to different draw costs), which enhances the fun of the deck building process. <\/li><\/ul><br>The game also includes <strong>Roguelike elements<\/strong>, <strong>sci-fi-themed star travel<\/strong> and <strong>colony building<\/strong>, <strong>technology trees<\/strong>, and <strong>a plot that explores the cult of prosthetics<\/strong>, ensuring that the game is rich in content.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/1_EN.png?t=1657769532\" \/><br>The core gameplay of the game requires you to flexibly use both sides of the cards to control your units to kill enemies and complete mission objectives, which is also the bridge between cards and wargames. After the cards are flipped over, you can give your unit action points to control the unit's movement and attack. This design also allows the hand to be completely free of wasted card hands, while the pieces do not have a limit of 1 action per turn, taking care of both the card and wargame systems at the same time.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/1正面出牌_V2.gif?t=1657769532\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/2翻面_V2.gif?t=1657769532\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/4_EN.png?t=1657769532\" \/><br>While traditional card games have cards that all require <strong>[cost]<\/strong> to be played, White Night Starry Souls uses a different <strong>bandwidth draw<\/strong> mechanic. At the start of the round, you are required to manually draw cards, which are divided into four colors - white, blue, purple, and gold - that cost between 1 and 4 bandwidth points, respectively, and the bandwidth will automatically fill up at the start of each round. This design changes the excessive randomness of the <strong>cost limit<\/strong> + <strong>auto-draw<\/strong> mechanic, giving players more control over their hand and allowing for more flexible and strategic grouping.<br><br>For example: you can always keep only 1 purple card in your entire deck, so that at the beginning of the turn, there is always only 1 card in the purple deck, and you can draw that card at any time you want, and draw it every turn as you wish. Of course this also requires you to pay more bandwidth and you will get less cards in your hand. Thus, by controlling a deck of 4 colors, you can adjust the randomness of DBG to a certain extent, ensuring that the DBG experience is integrated with a highly strategic wargaming system.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/3带宽_V2.gif?t=1657769532\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1772050\/extras\/6_EN.png?t=1657769532\" \/><br>The game is in the form of Meat Pigeon + DBG, which traditional Roguelike card players should be comfortable with.
