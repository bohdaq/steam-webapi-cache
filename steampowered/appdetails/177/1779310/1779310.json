Players fire guns, shoot energy bows, and toss explosive spears to defend the Human Federation from an infestation of Bugs From Space.

You receive new weapons as you progress through each level, including guns, different arrows for the energy bow, and throwables such as fission grenades and futuristic spears. Enemy bugs spit projectiles that you can either try and shoot down, or dodge. Between dodging, throwing, shooting bows, and firing guns, this is a physically active game, so make sure your play space is clear of obstacles.   <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlso, Bugs From Space is a room-scale VR game that maximizes comfort and minimizes risk of VR sickness by using teleportation to move between battle stations, with all other movement based on the player's real world movement.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game will be released in early access, so watch for new content, weapons, boss fights, and more!","about_the_game":"Bugs From Space is a fast-paced VR arcade shooter.
