Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are:<br><br><strong>• Resistance Pitchfork<\/strong> - At first glance it could be dismissed as a simple farmer’s tool, but this pitchfork has been reinforced and transformed into an effective Resistance weapon. The pitchfork has excellent reach, which is great for doing damage from a safer distance.<br><br><strong>• Resistance Heavy Bow<\/strong> - Built using scavenged machine parts, this heavy bow packs a powerful punch, but requires more skill to use. The enhanced power of the bow also allows it to fire heavy, modified arrows, making this a versatile tool.<br><br><strong>• Resistance Flamethrower <\/strong>- While it may look like an accident waiting to happen, the flamethrower's powerful napalm fuel causes massive damage to machines by sticking to them while it burns, quickly melting its vulnerable internal parts.<br><br><strong>Special weapon ammo and attachments include:<\/strong><br><br><strong>• Resistance Standard Arrow<\/strong> - A regular arrow that does a lot of damage to components but is weak against armor.<br><br><strong>• Resistance Explosive Arrow<\/strong> - A special type of arrow that explodes on impact, dealing extra explosive damage to its target.<br><br><strong>• Resistance Flare Arrow<\/strong> - An arrow with an emergency flare attached. The lit flare will lure any enemy's attention and fire away from you and onto the flare, even if that flare is now pinned to another machine.<br><br><strong>• 3-Pin Makeshift Bow Sight<\/strong> - This 3-Pin Bow sight features three pins calibrated to hit at a certain distance, working best when the distance to the target is known. <br><br><strong>• Large Flamethrower Tank<\/strong> - A larger tank that can hold more fuel, letting you relentlessly melt enemy machines for longer without needing to refuel.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1771050\/extras\/GZ-ResistanceWeaponsPack_Description-Image_3_616x257.png?t=1652342376\" \/>","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1771050\/extras\/GZ-ResistanceWeaponsPack_Description-Image_1_616x257.gif?t=1652342376\" \/><br><br>When times get tough, tenacious Resistance fighters need to find more creative ways to keep their armory stocked with effective weapons.
