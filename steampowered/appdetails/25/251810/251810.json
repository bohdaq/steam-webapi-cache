This makes it easier than ever to create games with amazing graphics.<br><br><strong>Vegetation Painting System<\/strong><br>Leadwerks Game Engine 4 introduces a one-of-a-kind vegetation system for handling massive amounts of foliage. Instead of storing each instance in memory, our new system uses a distribution algorithm to dynamically calculate all relevant instances each frame for rendering and physics. This allows enormous densely packed scenes with minimal overhead. The results are blazingly fast, efficient, and easy to use.<br><br><strong>Advanced Graphics<\/strong><br>Leadwerks makes AAA graphics achievable with hardware tessellation, geometry shaders, and a deferred renderer with up to 32x MSAA.

The use of OpenGL 4.0 provides equivalent graphics to DirectX 11, with cross-platform support across operating systems, for future expansion.<br><br><strong>Built-in Level Design Tools<\/strong><br>Build game levels from scratch right in our editor with constructive solid geometry.  Our tools make it easy to sketch out your design and bring your ideas to life.

Lua integrates seamlessly with native code for rapid prototyping and instant control.  The built-in debugger lets you pause your game, step through code, and inspect every variable in the program in real-time.  Lua is perfect for beginners, and the integrated Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler ensures your games will keep running fast as they grow.  (Please note that C++ programming support requires the Standard Edition DLC.)<br><br><strong>Visual Flowgraph for Advanced Game Mechanics<\/strong><br>Our unique visual flowgraph enables designers to set up game mechanics, build interactions, and design advanced scripted sequences, without touching a line of code.  The flowgraph system integrates seamlessly with Lua script, allowing script programmers to expose their own functions and add new possibilities for gameplay.<br><br><strong>Royalty-Free License<\/strong><br>Your games you make are yours.  Yours to play, yours to sell, yours to give away, and do as you please.  You will never be charged royalties for any game you make in Leadwerks.
