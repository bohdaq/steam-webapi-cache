Users can publish their maps to all players. You can copy vehicles from other maps, alter them, or build your own vehicle from scratch to use on your own track. The map editor start with randomly generating a terrain, then road constructions will automatically modify the terrain to resemble real life infrastructure. With the geometry editor you can create objects, movable or non-movable to use as obstacles, gates, cargo, or add wheels and motor to create a vehicle or heavy machine.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe demo is limited to a few selected maps, the free map of the day, and your own creations.","about_the_game":"Tricky Machines is a physics based racing game.
