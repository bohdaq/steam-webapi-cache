It appealed to veterans of the strategy genre, while the intense, non-stop action of the battles brings the game close to being an action title, making it equally accessible to fight junkies like us.”<br \/>\r\n84% – Retro Gamer (February 2006)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“This game offers an excellent war simulation and many trials will be necessary before reaching a winning strategy, even at the easiest level.”<br \/>\r\n83% – Tilt (May 1984)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“The graphics and overall presentation are excellent ... It gets to the point where you barely have any time left to think ... An excellent game”<br \/>\r\n78% – Crash! (March 1984)<br \/>\r\n","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/header.jpg?t=1654500799","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 50 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 20 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Imagine"],"publishers":["Pixel Games UK"],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":4000,"final":4000,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"40₴"},"packages":[723630],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Stonkers","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":723630,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Stonkers - 40₴","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":4000}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"}],"genres":[{"id":"2","description":"Strategy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_61c0fb4789eb544328d3128f39ab4f9e081ea48f.600x338.jpg?t=1654500799","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_61c0fb4789eb544328d3128f39ab4f9e081ea48f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654500799"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_1d0a955b31262adea4703bdc15bbfdea7e7bf2c5.600x338.jpg?t=1654500799","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_1d0a955b31262adea4703bdc15bbfdea7e7bf2c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654500799"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_f861d25b8bc495a2470cabf996b8afdb7045bbc4.600x338.jpg?t=1654500799","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_f861d25b8bc495a2470cabf996b8afdb7045bbc4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654500799"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_0f76096784921ae63a76c174009966bdf5a9eb53.600x338.jpg?t=1654500799","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_0f76096784921ae63a76c174009966bdf5a9eb53.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654500799"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_6801529f713f0d6413386b105cea10aa44c61b84.600x338.jpg?t=1654500799","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/ss_6801529f713f0d6413386b105cea10aa44c61b84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654500799"}],"movies":[{"id":256887151,"name":"Stonkers","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256887151\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1653291152","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256887151\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1653291152","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256887151\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1653291152"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256887151\/movie480.mp4?t=1653291152","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256887151\/movie_max.mp4?t=1653291152"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"6 Jun, 2022"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"info@pixelgames.uk"},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654500799","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004300\/page.bg.jpg?t=1654500799","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
