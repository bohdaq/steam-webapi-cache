This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful. In some cases the simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2004650\/header.jpg?t=1654695216","website":"http:\/\/www.sailsim.app","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Core i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Any 3D accelerator<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 300 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Core i7<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Any 3D accelerator<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 400 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"developers":["Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko"],"publishers":["Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko"],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":5900,"final":5900,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"59â‚´"},"packages":[723765],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy SailSim","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":723765,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"SailSim -
