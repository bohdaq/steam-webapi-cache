After buying him a few drinks, he starts telling stories. One of those stories was about a rich isolated island where he once lived, but a horrible event took place one night and he had to run for his life. No one believed him. After some harassing and name calling the stranger would reveal the location of the mysterious island. Of course, the smartest decision was to get on your dad’s boat and visit the island. Near the mysterious island everything goes south when the ship sails into a storm. You and your friends are transported to the mysterious island. The boat is no longer seaworthy and at first sight, it looks like you are stranded for the time being. After moving more inland you understand that something is very wrong with this place.
