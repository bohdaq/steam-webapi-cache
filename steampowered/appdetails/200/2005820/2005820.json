{"2005820":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Soul Shard","steam_appid":2005820,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"detailed_description":"Soul Shard is a 3D platformer, 2-player local coop game set in a Victorian London Steampunk factory. Young Nimue, a 12-year old child inventor, and here sidekick Ambrose, a cyborg bear of her invention, are on a mission to destroy the factory so that it can no longer produce cyborg laborers that the owner has been using to replace the working class. The game uses an &quot;artifact&quot; placement mechanic that creates dynamically generated platforms which vary in shape and size depending on the use of one to three artifacts. The artifact placement, and therefore platforms, are generated by Ambrose while Nimue has the ability to change their nature. They use these platforms to progress through the factory by solving puzzles and facilitating Nimue's avoidance of the cyborg enemies.
