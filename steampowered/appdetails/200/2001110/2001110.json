Watch carefully how your enemies move every turn. Plan to attack near with a physical strike, or far, with a burst of elemental magic when you fuse mana into groups. Every decision counts because as the clock ticks, more foes threaten to appear from strange portals in the walls.<br><br>The castle is on high alert though, and every room is on lockdown. Aside from defeating enemies, you will also have to deactivate the magical intruder alarm systems. Uncover sigils on the floor, blast crystals with mana and step on raised floor panels to clear the room. It's strange however, because the castle defence system seems too elaborate to have been made to just keep out, lets say, just a Nekomancer from coming in to look for the Nekonomicon...<br><br>And, additional words of caution! Many of the rooms have been taken over by elemental forces. Be careful not to slide right into the lava from the Cryovolcanic Plane, and stay away from the superheated gas from the Elemental Plane of Steam. Remove the sticky floors from the Elemental Plane of Mud before you step in them. But what affects you...also affects your enemies! So lure them into traps when you have the chance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Turn based combat in a grid based environment, with randomly generated level layouts and items.
