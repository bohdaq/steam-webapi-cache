He tried every possible legal trick, scam, and even resorted to emotional blackmail in order to try to wrest The Silly Clown from his mother’s hands. She finally got so sick of her own son that she encoded the TFN onto a holographic crystal. Then she built the most heavily guarded, highly automated facility in the world in order to protect it. In her will, she said that The Silly Clown should be immediately destroyed upon her passing, to make sure that her obsessed son didn’t try anything drastic.<br><br>That meant if Aldar wanted to own the majesty of The Silly Clown… he would need to steal it.","about_the_game":"A short 3D platformer with a Rich story and really difficult gameplay and challenging puzzle<br>--Full controller support <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                                                                                ------------------<strong>The Story<\/strong>------------------<br><br><br><br>Aldar was a technologist.
