Lurking somewhere in this vast landscape, exploration will become a real key in finding it. You can go at this task Solo, or cover ground faster with the help of others. Climb tall mountains and scour deep valleys, searching for where the Dreadnought calls home, this time around. The Dreadnought is the strongest and most difficult enemy to destroy in the game, but fortunately there is a proper way to go about this fight.<br><br>The world is filled with Dark Magic, and all of the creatures, bosses, and even the Dreadnought feeds off this Darkness for ultimate strength. A Dreadnought at full strength is a powerhouse, and to attempt this fight at beginning stages, even with a strong group of four, would still likely be suicide. Finding the Dreadnought in early game is always helpful, and with the ability to mark it on the map after discovery, you will at least know where to avoid, until you can bring down the world’s Dark Magic Level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LUMINARIES<\/h2>Your character is your own.

At the forefront of Luminary is Role Playing, and we want the player to choose to look how they want, and even play how they want. There are no defined classes, you progress through your actions. Want to get better with fire magic, then use it. How about your tolerance to poisons? Get poisoned. Bows? then use them. The more you use any measurable tool\/item\/weapon\/armor the greater your proficiency at that thing becomes. <br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1648360\/extras\/SteamLuminaryCharacters.JPG?t=1623792340\" \/><br><br>However, maybe you aren't into combat but still want to hang out with your friends.
