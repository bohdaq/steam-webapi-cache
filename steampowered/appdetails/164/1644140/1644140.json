You are rewarded of every block you place and every task you fullfill, so gaining points can be tricky!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1644140\/extras\/text_03.jpg?t=1623394779\" \/><br><br>Valley of No Roads has a strong focus on the sceneries you build, so you'll have full control over the camera and UI, just to get the most serene videos and screenshots.
