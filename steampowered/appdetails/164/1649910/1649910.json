The hammer ricochets across the screen, bouncing off enemies, walls, and numerous environmental objects, sometimes even feeling a bit like Arkanoid or Breakout. Using guide lines to help you, you can throw the hammer at precise angles to achieve trick shots that, for example, hit a shielded enemy from behind or solve a physics puzzle. The entire game has been artfully designed — and redesigned — around this mechanic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the demo?<\/h2>This is the first public demo we released to the world. It contains the first 3 levels. The content may change for the final game because we want to use the feedback we get to further improve on the game.
