I'd first just like to take the time to thank all of you for being here and supporting this multi-media passion project of mine.  Getting this done through my first year of university has been a challenge to say the least, and I couldn't have done it without you.  With that said, if you would like to support me so that I can continue to deliver quality works of art to the public, I've included the full album to purchase as a soundtrack!  This would be an incredible help to me as I continue to make music, make games, and continue my education.  I truly hope I can continue to make project to make you all proud!
