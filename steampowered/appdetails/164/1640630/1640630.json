And damn, it looks so good in black and white. I’m super-intrigued to find out how the storytelling works here, especially as they drop genres like “rogue-like” and themes like “moral choices”. And resource management? I think this could be seriously good.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/indie-penance-day-resurgence-1847231469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku<\/a><br><br>“You'll start each playthrough by answering questions about your vigilante driver and why they're on the run. That'll influence what kind of radio chatter you hear as you drive along, because apparently your antics are all over the airwaves.
