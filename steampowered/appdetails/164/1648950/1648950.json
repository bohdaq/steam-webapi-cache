Recording over the course of 2 years, <i>The Colossus Is Coming<\/i> is an art rock \/ experimental rock record with many influences from contemporary jazz, electronica, post-punk, noise rock, hip-hop, and many other genres, blending all of them into a unique listening experience.

There are no real wrong answers<br><br>I'd like to thank everybody who's taken the time to listen to my newest musical project.

I really hope you all will continue to support me through my different artistic endeavors as I continue to evolve and improve.  If you haven't, I implore you to give The Colossus Is Coming: The Interactive Experience a look.
