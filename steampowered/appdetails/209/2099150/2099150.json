She still has kept a playful personality despite her past. That is mainly because she has never found the crusaders to be much of a problem because of her skill with a scythe as well as having vampire strength. She is very confident in her fighting skills and is very enthusiastic about finding Galahad, her new play thing.<\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><\/h2><strong><u>Slan<\/u><\/strong> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2099150\/extras\/Slan_0.25.gif?t=1659209763\" \/><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Of the three sisters in arms, she is the eldest of them.

She underwent the tortures she herself had inflicted on others and because of that became blind in one eye. She however managed to escape from the Church’s clutches and now turns her blade against her former comrades who did her wrong.
