About the Utsushiyochigai<\/strong><br>　Utsushiyochigai<br>　It is a world that exists parallel to the present world in which we live, a world inhabited by gods and Yokai.<br>　It is a parallel world that was once connected to this world, another Japan.<br><br>　The inhabitants of the two worlds have long held traditional festivals and events, <br>　and humans, gods, and Yokai have shared civilizations. However, with the passage of time, <br>　interaction with the Utsushiyochigai decreased and their culture became obsolete. <br>　Eventually, humans forgot their boundaries with the Utsushiyochigai and lost their relationship with the gods and Yokai. <br>　In this way, the gods and Yokai became a part of this world. <br>　Thus, gods and Yokai disappeared from our world and were treated as phantom beings. <br>　They are now treated as phantom beings.<br><br>　<strong>Ⅱ. About &quot;KIK”<\/strong><br>　Setsuna is an office worker. <br>　Through a certain event, she meets the Yokai Tsukumo and is able to travel between the two worlds.<br>　Tsukumo is a clock Yokai and can use the power of &quot;Kokuikkoku(KIK)&quot; to manipulate time.<br>　Setsuna, too, has learned to use her Yokai powers through her encounter with Tsukumo, <br>　and has gained the ability to fight Yokai.<br>　Tsukumo is bored.<br>　Tsukumo offers Setsuna an interesting proposition. <br>　The two of them then go to Utsushiyochigai to exterminate Yokai, which is their daily routine.<br><br>　<strong>Ⅲ. The Beginning<\/strong><br>　There is an abandoned house on a secluded beach in Utsushiyochigai.<br>　Once upon a time, there were many houses near this beach, and the area flourished as a fisherman's village.<br>　One day, however, a young man who went fishing suddenly disappeared.<br>　People gradually moved away from the beach, <br>　thinking it was the work of a terrifying Yokai, but the young man's family did not leave the beach and continued to wait for his return.<br>　In the end, however, the young man never returned home.<br>　One day, several hundred years later, an eerie voice could be heard coming from an abandoned house in the middle of the night. <br>　It turned out to be the family of the young man who had become a Yokai out of hatred for the sea that had kidnapped their son. <br>　Day by day, the voices grew louder and louder.<br>　The voices grew louder and louder day by day, and more and more Yokai began to appear on the beach. Soon, <br>　the sea became rough on many days due to the influence of the Yokai, and no one went out to fish.<br>　People were afraid and prayed to the gods for the Yokai to subside.<br><br>　<strong>Ⅳ. Beginning of Journey<\/strong><br>　Having overheard the whole story about the incident on the beach, <br>　Tsukumo was gathering information in Utsushiyochigai. <br>　Tsukumo's preliminary investigation had led him to the existence of an abandoned house<br>　that had fallen into disrepair, but he did not know why it had fallen into disrepair.<br>　Back in our world, Tsukumo happily told Setsuna about the incident at the beach.<br><br>　&quot;Setsuna, I know you've been wanting to go fishing lately.&quot;<br>　Setsuna knew what Tsukumo was going to say.<br>　<br> 　Setsuna says,&quot;What do you mean?

I'd rather eat fish than watch them dance.&quot;<br>　&quot;It would be more interesting if the fish danced.&quot;<br>　&quot;Calm down. Fish can't dance.&quot;<br>　&quot;Are you going? You're not going?&quot;<br>　&quot;Yes, yes. I'm going.&quot;<br>　They thought that there was a powerful youkai in the abandoned house, <br>　so they set out on another journey to Utsushiyochigai today.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The second installment of the &quot;刻一刻(KIK)&quot; series!<\/h2>　<i>Setsuna is a human who has acquired the power of a yokai.<br>　Setsuna meets Tsukumo, a clock yokai.<\/i><br>　<br>　They confront yokai in an attempt to solve <br>　the mysteriousness of the cursed beach!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description<\/h2>Retro arcade-style STG is here!<br>Can you withstand the oncoming barrage of bullets in a Japanese-style world?<br><br>This game has the basic STG elements as they are, with the following original elements.<br>・Stop the time! ：KIK (Koku-I-Kkoku)<br>・Attack power up!
