This consists of walking to specific store items and aisles, waiting a few seconds in front of an object to simulate the choosing\/taking process, and then going to another store item and repeating this process until they run out of time. <br>All shoppers will spend a random amount of time in the store, between a minimum and maximum (hard-coded) which guarantees a maximum length of the simulation.
