In a way, it’s our homage to the soundtrack of old, where you had kickass metal tunes in 2.5 shooters. However, pure metal would be boring. Fortunately, the soundtrack was composed by the talented Tim Fialka, who knew this and properly spiced it up. So instead of just guitars and drums, you can hear orchestral and electronic bits too. We do hope it sounds unique to you - Lovecraftian, but not in a generic manner.","about_the_game":"Forgive Me Father may just as well be the first Lovecraftian game where the somber sounds of violin get replaced with METAL (it probably isn’t, but still - it’s a rare combination).
