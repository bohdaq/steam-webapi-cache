She has all the characteristics of a mongrel - she barks, likes to chase her own tail, and learns about the world through her senses. Bea can sniff, listen and observe. These are the main mechanics of detective mode which will help her in exploring and understanding her environment.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2058950\/extras\/header_2.png?t=1659189134\" \/><br>In the full game - Space Tail: Every Journey Leads Home - Bea travels through space discovering more planets. Each planet is different and has its specific inhabitants, who can either become friends of the main character or be very unfriendly towards her.
