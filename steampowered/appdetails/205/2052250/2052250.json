It is a story-rich dungeon crawler about a man who always wanted to be a great hero and earn his unique title in the adventure community, who ends up having his dream turn to ash before it can even begin. You guide him through the aftermath of a traumatic event where his hero agrees to train him only to decide he isn't worthy and leaves you for dead after a botched boss fight. You end up following a voice in your head that guides you to safety, leading you to a hidden room no one has been in for ages. While dying slowly, you end up drinking an unknown potion in hopes of saving your life in hopes of giving you enough mana to activate an old teleportation stone in the room.<br><br>It works but at a significant cost, the potion that is a remnant of civilizations past, a drink outlawed by the current kingdom and its church. Its meant to give the drinker the ability to see and talk to the spirits or gods and is reserved only for shamans of old. In a nutshell, it's a mana potion so potent that if you don't die from the overdose, you get magically more powerful, but the church's stance on it also breaks your mind and makes you crazy as to why you can see spirits they say don't exist.<br><br><u><strong>Struggle<\/strong><\/u>:<br>You will struggle after the prologue both physically as you fight monsters on your adventure and as you struggle with Zed, who claims to be the voice who guided you.
