In terms of combat system, bone-based hit feedback is used, which really makes you feel the blow. All monsters can be executed, ordinary monsters can also backstabbed, and the process of waiting for execution is added before being executed, which are all operations that can be experienced, not cutscenes.<br \/>\r\nRise of the Underworld has a day-night cycle in terms of the time system, and can also control time through meditation, and in terms of weather system, rain and snow are well represented, and they can also interact with the scene. The whole game strives to be perfect, but given that the game is a personal production, although it took several years, but in the end the energy and funds can not keep up, so the game still has a lot of shortcomings, I hope you can understand how difficult it is to develop a game independently.","about_the_game":"Hasius was the son of Zeus and Danaeus, born a demigod on earth.
