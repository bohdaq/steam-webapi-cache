Wonder no longer! You play as a humble merchant and quest giver in a kingdom filled with magic, mystery and danger. Take on the many tasks that one must do to maintain a thriving hero shop, hone your crafting abilities to sell and trade increasingly powerful items with other NPC’s and the many prospective heroes in your realm. Establish ongoing trade routes and fulfill deliveries to neighboring traders and vendors to increase your reputation and earn exclusive gifts. Create and manage your own guild to take on many dangers alongside the other AI driven heroes in the world with similar goals. Send your guild officers on grand quests either solo or with party members to battle their way through solo and group dungeons, seeking to find unique items that increase your heroes' strength across 17 different hero boosting stats. Use the most powerful gear to take on the greater dangers in the realm, including powerful world bosses, mysterious rare spawns, and massive raids calling for up to 40 brave heroes. Be warned, death waits for none in this realm, and should any hero perish, they are truly lost. Explore the realm and search for strange artifacts which lead to grand adventures containing wonderful prizes, large and small. Do all you can in the main campaign to aid in protecting the ancient and powerful Elemental Stones from any that seek to harm the balance.","about_the_game":"Ever wonder what it would be like to play as an NPC within an MMORPG world?
