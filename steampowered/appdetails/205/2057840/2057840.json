Get your mouse and headset ready, this game will test your rhythm and aim – pull off sick flicks to the beat and track to the bass!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn this game, the player is tasked with shooting objects that appear in carefully designed 3D spaces, to the beat of especially produced music. Imagine a rhythm game but with the entire map as the note highway. It will challenge the player’s sense of rhythm, as well as their skill in first-person perspective aiming. They will have to flick: quickly move the crosshair to the target and click, and track: keep the crosshair on a moving target – all in time with the music!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt its core, BEAT AIMER! is a skill-based game. It builds upon two great traditions of rhythm games and first-person shooters, both of which encourage mastery through play. It is our intention to inherit this spirit; this game will reward players for their precision, both rhythmically and mechanically.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is not to say that our community will be exclusive to high-skilled players. After all, we want our game to be fun for everyone! In fact, it is our wish to build a community not only of players of all levels but also of creators. We plan to implement a beat-map editor and uploader, so that people can share their creations. In this sense, this game belongs not to us, but to the community.","about_the_game":"BEAT AIMER! is a rhythm shooter where you shoot to the beat.
