New branches can be unlocked and discovered, hidden areas can be unearthed, and secrets can be found through unconventional puzzle mechanics that test both your creativity and abstract puzzle solving skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONFRONT YOUR INNER DEMONS<\/h2>During her journey, Sara must learn to confront and overcome the demons hunting after her. Taking the form of her own personal traumas, her own mind is often the greatest enemy. Unsure who to trust, she must find a way to avoid different terrifying threats whilst piecing together the fragments of her mind to feel whole again. She must decide whether the greatest enemy is herself, or the person controlling her.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEARN NEW LOGIC<\/h2>Raven’s Point is a game that constantly changes around you. Each room is unique and offers multiple secrets and methods of exploration.
