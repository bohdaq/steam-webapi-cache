Raven's Point is also a game. Solve puzzles and explore a seemingly never-ending maze of unnerving hallways and rooms inside a terrifying house of secrets. You're not only trapped within the town of Raven's Point, you're also trapped within the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEEP EXPLORATION<\/h2>Dive down into the rabbit hole of Sara’s mind-bending, ever-changing home. Rooms will appear and disappear and new paths will unearth themselves as you explore deeper and deeper into the darkest recesses of the house. With dozens of alternate paths to take and hundreds of secrets waiting to be found, the world of Raven’s Point is shrouded in both mystery and intrigue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABSTRACT PUZZLE-SOLVING<\/h2>In Sara’s attempt to escape her home, the house itself is a puzzle waiting to be solved. New branches can be unlocked and discovered, hidden areas can be unearthed, and secrets can be found through unconventional puzzle mechanics that test both your creativity and abstract puzzle solving skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONFRONT INNER DEMONS<\/h2>During her journey, Sara must confront and overcome the demons hunting after her. Taking the form of her own personal traumas, her own mind is often the greatest enemy. Throughout each segment of the house, Sara faces many entities and voices. Unsure who to trust, she must find a way to avoid different terrifying threats whilst piecing together the fragments of her memories to feel whole again. She must decide whether the greatest enemy is herself or the person controlling her.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEARN NEW LOGIC<\/h2>Raven’s Point is a game that constantly changes around you. Each room is unique and offers multiple secrets and methods of exploration. Objects that weren’t there before may suddenly appear, rooms that were there before are suddenly different, things that wouldn’t normally be possible are suddenly viable. Raven’s Point is a game meant to be played like it’s a game. It aims to create a whole new world of logic that leaves you questioning what is real and which secrets were meant to be discovered. A feeling of accomplishment yet emptiness. A feeling you didn’t want to experience. Become immersed in the town of Raven’s Point but don’t forget everything is trapped within the window. Don’t be afraid to break the rules.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A house with a seemingly impossible layout that changes around each move you make.<br><\/li><li>Unique puzzles with surreal solutions.<br><\/li><li>A variety of twisted bosses, each with their own new gameplay elements.<br><\/li><li>Numerous characters to encounter with their own tragic tales and questionable motives.<br><\/li><li>Lots and lots of secrets.<br><\/li><li>Places you aren’t meant to find.<\/li><\/ul><br>Disclaimer: <br><i>This game contains themes of depression and anxiety which may make it unsuitable for some audiences.<\/i>","about_the_game":"Raven's Point is a town.
