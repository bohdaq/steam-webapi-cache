You play as Syd, teenage boy who goes to Foster Hill High - a school in a quiet Australian town. The school year is coming to a close and Syd has to decide how he's going to confess his feelings to his crush - all this while juggling several other friendships and potential love interests in his life.<br><br>Such as Maisy, the wild and outgoing girl who lives on the same street as Syd and calls him her &quot;best friend.&quot;<br>Jayda, the sweet and awkward artsy weeb who loves anime and video games and thinks the world of Syd.<br>And of course the cool and intellectual Steph, who loves books and music... and who happens to be the person that Syd has been crushing on all year.<br><br>Spend time with these characters in a close-knit friendship group over the last four weeks of school, deepening your friendships - and potentially growing them into something more! But be careful, each decision you make can affect the entire friendship group. Spend too much time with one character, and the others will notice. This can result in all kinds of interactions, such as other characters trying to help Syd confess his feelings or deepen his relationship. Or alternatively, in the worst case scenario, your choices may lead to other character getting jealous and even betraying you! <i>LoveSick Darlings<\/i> is packed with group conversations where you get to know characters not only by interacting with them yourself, but by watching how they treat your other friends too.<br><br>Determine the fate of Syd and all his friends as you help him make some of the hardest decisions in his life so far. You will help Syd prepare how he confesses his feelings, accept or deny the feelings of others, sabotage or repair broken friendships, and get to know Syd's friends in a way that he never did before.
