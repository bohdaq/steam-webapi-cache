Every move, every decision, every action, and reaction you make will influence and decide the outcome of each encounter you will face along the way. <br><br>One thing that separates Delphyq from the rest of the strategy and tactics crowd is the way it simulates real combat. Delphyq is not a turn-based game; despite it having a pause mechanic, combat is still handled in real-time. The game’s waypoints, look direction and dynamic cover systems open doors for intense, strategic, and memorable encounters. Advanced functions such as <i>GoCodes<\/i> and Operative skills provide access to deeper tactical maneuvers to deal with the game’s extremely intelligent utility-based AI enemies. <br><br>Each AI unit functions in conjunction with its environment; depending on the situation, it will also try to coordinate with other AI in the field and will attempt to flank the Operatives and\/or engage them through the use of cover.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1150820\/extras\/01.gif?t=1634664878\" \/><br><br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1150820\/extras\/Headers_keyfeatures_0925.png?t=1634664878\" \/><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>REAL TACTICS IN REAL TIME:<\/strong> In Delphyq, combat does not happen in turns.
