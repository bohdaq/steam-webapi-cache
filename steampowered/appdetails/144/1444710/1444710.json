{"1444710":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"FireJumpers Inferno","steam_appid":1444710,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"FireJumpers Inferno is an indie game that offers players access to play cooperative multiplayer wildland firefighting scenarios anywhere in the continental United States! This forest fire fighting game has instant access to over 612,000 map tiles each with 15,000 pixels of GIS data (DLCs).  These map tiles can be assembled together to generate small 4km x 4km maps to epic 200km x 200km size maps! The scale is 1:30 which means that every pixel of data on the map represents a 30m x 30m area. You'll have access to over 9.1 billion pixels of GIS data of real locations!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis wildland firefighting simulator uses real GIS data from the US Landfire government website and calculates fire spread based on Rothermel’s Surface Fire Spread Model. What that means is that there are 40 different ways a fire can burn. For example, there are 9 different fuel codes for grass, each with its own rate of spread based on wind speed. The unit movements are scaled accurately based on these fuel codes. A brush truck moves faster on a road (100km\/h) but slower through low shrubs (20km\/h). <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFireJumpers Inferno is a game where a player starts off as a beginner-level Incident Commander in charge of 4 different agency types: Groundcrew, Dozer, Water Suppression, and Aircraft. Each agency will have a specified budget that will accommodate the hiring of units. These units also start at the beginner-level and players can upgrade them with experience points and in-game coins that are earned by completing scenarios! The scenarios are completed when the wildfires are contained, which means that the perimeter of the wildfires must be extinguished, either by direct fire attack, water suppression, fire lines and\/or aircraft water\/retardant support. Up to 200 simultaneous players will be able to team up on the same scenario and cooperatively contain wildfires.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere is still work to do and I'm planning to get the minimum viable product ready for release.  There are many more features I'll be adding after launch. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlease support this indie game and add it to your wishlist!","about_the_game":"FireJumpers Inferno is an indie game that offers players access to play cooperative multiplayer wildland firefighting scenarios anywhere in the continental United States!
