Start from simple monsters and skeletons and with time build up your defences. You can play any monster from your army and give them specific orders to follow. Every killed hero makes them stronger and gives you an opportunity to equip them better or develop new skills or monstrosities. You can reanimate fallen intruders or collect pieces of your slain warriors and research new ways to use it. <br><br>Develop your preferred Style. You can focus on specific Style or mix them together to create a unique army of loyal Monsters. Choose from Necromancy, Vivisection, Mutation, Runes, Elixirs, Talismans, Forge, Techie, Strategy, Roguery, Drilling or Sorcery and different schools of Dark Magic.<br><br>Grow your beasts and monsters, make them unique or identical with others to unlock specific skill trees, upgrades and abilities. Combine unique equipment and skills and create your Bosses or Swarms. <br><br>Styles are complex systems focused on specific areas but combined with others allow to create more powerful weapons and upgrades. The vivisected finger of the mage combined with some elixirs can be a very powerful upgrade for your simple skeleton. Reanimated corpse of a fallen hero with some fresh mutations and newly forged weapons can make a really nice new Boss for your realm.<br><br>Loot all you can as bodies decay and some treasures can be lost to nasty imps or other thieves. Store you treasures as a lure for visitors or forge them into powerful objects. Every piece matters. Study new materials and runes, develop schematics for your traps and devices, collect limbs, flesh and bones for your experiments and new creations.<br><br>Learn and experiment. The way your monsters kill new heroes can be entertaining but also eye opening. Develop your Strategy and new Roguery tricks. Teach your zombies to play dead (sic!) or Drill skeletons to fight in formation. Experiment in your Forge with loot and spells and combine them into unique crafting materials.<br><br>Do all you can to defend you Monsters’ Domain!","about_the_game":"<a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1473260\/Black_Gold\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_2\" >https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1473260\/Black_Gold\/<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1703180\/Handyman_Corporation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_3\" >https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1703180\/Handyman_Corporation\/<\/a><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1442450\/extras\/addtowishlist_gif.gif?t=1657979528\" \/><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/snGWyvJbNv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1442450\/extras\/discord_bar2.png?t=1657979528\" \/><\/a><br><br>Your objective is to stop any visitors to your Monsters’ Domain.
