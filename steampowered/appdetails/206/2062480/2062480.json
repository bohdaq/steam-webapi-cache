The landscape the errant tennis ball springs over is very pretty indeed though it can get confusing as to what's dangerous and what isn't. Bounder is very neat indeed - it's fairly addictive and both pretty to see and listen to.”<br>91% – Amtix! (June 1986)<br><br>“I’ve got to give it to Gremlin Graphics for originality — I have never seen a game like it before. Once you start off, bouncing all over the place, it becomes quite addictive, operating your ball and dodging low flying birds and other weird looking nasties. [...] Gameplay is quite fast so you don’t get bored: there’s no way this one can get monotonous. Bounder is a game I can recommend.”<br>90% – Crash!
