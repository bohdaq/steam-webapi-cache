Perhaps you’ll choose Voltaire, the master tactician, who gets double the defensive terrain benefits and can construct a temporary bunker anywhere on the battlefield.  Or, you prefer to rule the skies with Estelle, the flying ace, who’s aircraft carry heavier payloads to their targets and who can call in an airstrike to deal devastating damage in a wide swath across the battlefield.
