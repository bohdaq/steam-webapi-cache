At the end of each mission, you will collect medals and earn various certificates with these medals. At the end of the game, these certificates will prove your strength as an agent and help you to receive your agent license. <br>In each level of the ‘Agent Simulation’, you will be evaluated according to your targeting skills. Before the limited time provided ends, you must kill all your enemies. Every successful head shot will get you more points! Of course, if you say ‘I am not that good’ and use up your time, you need to start over. Sorry for that! Sometimes you will be asked to complete the missions in such a limited time, you have to be fast and agile! It is a great environment to test yourself, is it not? You can skip the levels that you could not complete and still advance in the game. But it does not sound that great, right? We are talking about being an agent in here. <br>There will be three options offered in each level and those options will constantly change! For example, double bullets, double damage, slowing time down, blocking bullets or extra life, etc. You can strategize using any of these options! If you would like, you can repeat any level to test and improve your skills.<br>When you complete all levels of a lesson, you will receive an overall score including all points and medals you earned in that lesson. If your overall score is not high enough to move on to the next lesson, we regret to inform you that you have to work harder and spend more time by repeating all low scored levels. Do not forget that it is not easy to train an agent!<br>Earning enough certificates will allow you to receive your agent license at the end. According to your license score, you can see where you are in the world ranking or within your friends.<br>Fight to be the best!","about_the_game":"<a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/EqXabtH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1708050\/extras\/SteamDiscord.png?t=1653505633\" \/><\/a><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1708050\/extras\/SceneFallDown.gif?t=1653505633\" \/><br><br>Agent Simulation is an action, simulation, and strategy game in which each player shows their targeting skills and agility against enemies in a virtual environment.
