It has had the holy names of &quot;Taiyue&quot;, &quot;xuanyue&quot; and &quot;Da Yue&quot; since ancient times. It is also the human Taoist field of the Perfected Warrior emperor. It is known as an &quot;unparalleled scenic spot in ancient times and the first fairy mountain in the world&quot;. There are too many stories about the reputation of Wudang Mountain, but there is no doubt that Wudang Mountain and its Taoist culture constitute the most important chapter in Chinese traditional culture. Now, the immortal gate of Wudang, which has been hidden for many years in the immortal cultivation world, has finally unveiled its mystery.<br>On the East Sea, a lofty, hazy mountain of immortals suddenly appeared in the mortal world. Cultivators explored the place and found that it's a long-lost, boundless realm of immortals, and hidden within is a seclusive Taoist sect! The Taoist teachings of the sect are directly passed down from the Perfected Warrior. Its disciples have all mastered the essence of Tao and excel at expelling demons.
