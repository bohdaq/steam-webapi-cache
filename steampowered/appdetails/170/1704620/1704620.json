The result is three fascinating, 10-day campaigns in the Falklands, Hong Kong, and Finland. The Hong Kong campaign pits the RAF’s GR5\/7 against a variety of little seen Chinese fighters, including the Jian-6 and Shenyang J-8 “Finback.”<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game development team put significant effort into achieving realism, with extra emphasis on modeling the Harrier’s vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities.
