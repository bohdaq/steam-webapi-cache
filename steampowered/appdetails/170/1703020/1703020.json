You have to be careful and try to avoid obstacles. SpaceKraft has challenging controls that are easy to learn but hard to master. Strolling through in space and using a spacecraft in a frictionless environment feels so fun yet a little bit hard. You have to get used to the controls, it is like drifting on a snowy road with a car. Some planets have various gravity forces, so the gameplay changes depending on the planet you are around. There is no fight or war, just exploration and solving physics based puzzles and completing the duties.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1703020\/extras\/art_work_03.jpg?t=1640338585\" \/><br><br>ENVIRONMENT<br>You explore a galaxy which is made of objects that were teleported from earth. There are tons of boxes, daily objects, crystals are floating around, some of them were united and formed the steampunk themed planets. There are caves, gas stations, old machines, greyders, and retro buildings around. Some planets have different gravitational forces. And because of an anomaly the sizes of objects differ so much. There is a 2D hand painted \/ collage environment.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1703020\/extras\/ship001.jpg?t=1640338585\" \/><br><br>FEELING<br>You will experience both the strolling through the universe freely, and fast pacing thru the narrow areas like caves.
