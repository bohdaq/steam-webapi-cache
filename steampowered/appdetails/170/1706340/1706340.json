We ship the game with 50,000 known Winnable shuffles for both 1 Draw and 3 Draw variations. The 1.0.0 version of our solitaire bot was made to not be too incredibly clever, so all Winnable shuffles are guaranteed to be possible below 200 moves. Though a Winnable game is guaranteed to be possible, that does not mean you will always win it first time as sometimes moves can be made in ways where the game becomes bricked - impossible to finish in that state.

Due to this, we decided not to include any music with Big Klondike. So you can play your own music while you play.<br><br>Another part of the design is in the name, making the game Big. While we have a good start with this, we think we can do better, and so in future iterations will continue to make the game look and feel as Big as possible. <br><br>An important personal design goal for me was to make a Klondike solitaire which is enjoyable to as many people as possible. This goal focuses on customization and optional features. For 1.0.0 many of what I have planned is not included, and instead only the basics of customization are included.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Solitaire<\/h2><br>Big Klondike is a version of the very popular Klondike variation of solitaire.
