I adore Buriedbornes and wanted to create something very similar yet not free-to-play. <br><br>It’s a roguelike dungeon crawler featuring permadeath, strong progression between runs, decisions that truly matter, perks that change the way you play, and one-on-one turn-based battles. <br><br>Album Corvus is set up in a gritty dark fantasy setting.<br><br>Your goal is to descent the deadly procedurally generated dungeons filled with traps, ancient labs, treasures, and monsters.

You’ll have to think and decide practically anywhere in the game, be it a decision about keeping your current weapon or swapping it with a new one; grabbing an artifact or rerolling it for a possibly better one but with a risk of breaking it completely; stepping into a room with another Adventurer and an Event for great loot or choosing an easier fight with less significant reward.<br><br>You’ll be making decisions between runs as well: what Augment to buy; what character to upgrade; what is better for your Fencer - retaliation or more frequent events; what signature skill to use, etc. <br><br><strong>Deep character building<\/strong><br>Possibilities for build creation are vivid in Album Corvus.
