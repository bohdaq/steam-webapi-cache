It's you versus an unrelenting geometric force. Literally render them into pixels with devastating weapons and abilities including the coveted whip, plus missiles, mines, magnets and dash. Evade, outlast and play with style in Shwip's three main game modes, then take to the couch and play against your friends in Shwipball – a competitive battle arena inspired by air hockey. Post high-scores, dominate global leaderboards, and show your friends and strangers alike who’s boss. Are your thumbs ready?<br> <br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/349710\/extras\/Gameplay.gif?t=1635801802\" \/> <br>  <br>We insist Shwip be played as you wish. So we've given a few cool modes to ensure maximum levels of fun and excitement for everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Arcade<\/strong> <\/h2>Buckle up, buddy. This is three minutes of increasingly difficult enemies spawns and swarms with one objective; to turn you into dust. Arcade features all the ship weapon types and abilities with unlimited lives and ammo, so you better be ready. This is the arcade mode you grew up with and love, so post those high scores and show the world you are the Shwip master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Style<\/strong><\/h2>Complete a series of objectives based on weapon and ability combinations to unlock your ship's turbo mode. Once you reach maximum power, you can unleash an onslaught of turbo powered weaponry and abilities. Every time you activate turbo the difficulty increases, but so does the multiplier. You only have one life, so be careful out there.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Minefield<\/strong> <\/h2>You’re placed in an desolate environment with a wounded ship, a damaged weapons system and a serious case of home-sickness. There are mines scattered everywhere, and a series of checkpoints you need to fly through in order to maintain your ship's integrity. Survive as long as possible to reach #1.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ShwipBall<\/strong><\/h2>Team up or go solo in this local multiplayer air-hockey inspired competitive arena. Whip the ball into your opponents net or use your ship as a battering ram.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Practice<\/strong> <\/h2>Choose the enemy type and frequency and unleash your might. Great for learning how to gain style points or just to mess around and show off new skills to your friends and family. There are no time limits, so customize your gameplay experience and get your particle fix for the day. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/349710\/extras\/Whipz.gif?t=1635801802\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Enemies<\/strong><\/h2>These enemies will have you fiddling with your controllers in ways you never thought possible. Take solace in the beauty of their particle ridden demise. Shwip features a range of enemies from floaty pawns to pack hunting, pixel-thirsty units.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons<\/strong><\/h2>From industry standard cannons to the Shwip (the Ship with the whip, get it?). We give you an awesome array of cool weapons and abilities to use and abuse. Pro-tip : Each weapon has an alternate use. From a whip, to missiles, to mines, to boosting, to blasting to magnets. Destroy your enemies as you please!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Online Leaderboards &amp; Stats<\/strong><\/h2>Compete against the world and track global stats. Dominate the leaderboards by playing over and over and over again. There are no ship upgrades, so the entire play-field is level - get to it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Local Multiplayer<\/strong><\/h2>Trash-talk and taunt your friends and family in real time without delay with Shwip's local multiplayer. We grew up playing Mario Kart, Worms and Halo in cramped rooms with tiny CRTs, and we want to bring back that magical feeling. Shwip multiplayer features Arcade, Minefield and ShwipBall - A competitive space-whip-air hockey variant that is sure to make you question the integrity of your friendships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Controls<\/strong><\/h2>Honestly?
