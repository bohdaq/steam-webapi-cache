The FUTURE FANTASY collection is based around two themes that integrate together: the modern city and the sci-fi world of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis set includes 25+ new tilesets: everything you need to make a futuristic space station, complete with computer terminals and science equipment. A machine factory with moving conveyer belts, or a damp junkyard with concrete pipes and rusted cars, are perfect locations for dungeons. And of course a future setting isn't complete without a dark cyberpunk city. A more modern city is included too, with roads, highways, and modern-style houses for a suburban town. Modern interiors, with kitchen appliances, TVs, computer desks and more.\r\n\r\nThe collection includes over 50 character sprites, ranging from sci fi soldiers and mechanics to scientists and cyborgs to city police and urban punks. Four new hero characters have fully-animated side-view battlers!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* Over 50 new character sprites!\r\n* 12 Modern tilesets! Towns and cities with interior and exterior, even a junkyard.\r\n* 12 Sci Fi tilesets! Space station, science lab, machine factory, and a cyberpunk city.\r\n* 4 new animated Side-View Battlers for heroes.\r\n* Animated object sprites: flashing computer screens, moving conveyor belts, cars and treasure chests.\r\n* Fully compatible with previous Time Fantasy style graphics!\r\n* For use with RPG Maker MZ or the engine of your choice\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\nThe included &quot;military&quot; character sets were originally released in the base Time Fantasy character pack. \r\nThey are included here as bonus sprites because they fit with the theme of this expansion.\r\n\r\nTerms of Use:\r\n\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects\r\n* Contents can be edited\r\n* OK for use in games with gore\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","about_the_game":"This expansion pack is designed to bring your Time Fantasy world into the future!
