It introduces seriously deep gameplay with an emphasis on fleet control. It game has it all. Open space to explore, large-scale battles, crafty AI, and powerful space fleet control.

A variety of ship modules brings extra to your strategic planning. Decide on where to move next - an invisible naughty spy, heavy tank, or light and fast attacker? Heavy but defenseless (and cheap) fighter carrier or something that rocks the stars? Choose your weapons: fire and runaway rockets, long-range lasers, or shredding to bits cannons?
