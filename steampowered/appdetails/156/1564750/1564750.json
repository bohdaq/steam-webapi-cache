After I stop selling this DLC pack during the Early Access period, it will no longer be possible to purchase it in the future. I want to make sure that people who support the game at this early stage get something special, because there's a possibility I could take the game full time and really make something out of it, and if that happens it'd only be because people were willing to give the game a chance and support it at this early state. I would immensely appreciate that, so I want to make sure I can do something special for you guys in return.<br><br>That said, if you want to just wait until more stuff is available or cosmetics are earnable just in game, that's totally fine too! I appreciate anyone who's even just playing the game and having a good time. Thanks for checking this out!<br><br>Note: there's currently an issue when playing the game through Virtual Desktop, where sometimes the game can't authenticate your account correctly, and the DLC won't be available. If you launch Gorilla Tag through Steam, it should work, but if you launch the game directly through Virtual Desktop, then Steam might not be running and your DLC won't work.
