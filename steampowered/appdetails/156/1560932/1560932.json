Alco’s exploration of diesel-building dated to 1917, and Alco began building standard end-cab diesel switchers in the 1930s. In 1936, competitor Electro-Motive debuted its classic and successful line of “E-unit” passengers diesels and Alco needed to create a competitor to the formidable Electro-Motive E-unit.<br><br>Alco’s answer arrived in January 1940 in the form of a 2,000-horsepower, six axle (A1A-A1A) diesel passenger locomotive powered by a pair of 6-cylinder power plants. The new locomotive was striking in appearance, styled with a long, knife-sharp nose by noted industrial designer Otto Kuhler. Before World War II, Alco built a modest number of such units – and then entered the famed New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad. In what was a pioneering concept at the time, New Haven intended to employ Alco’s passenger locomotive – designated the DL109 – as a “dual-service” diesel which would haul passengers by day and tote freight and mail at night. Between 1941 and 1945, the New Haven acquired sixty DL109s.<br><br>New Haven over the years splashed its diesels in many colors and the Alco DL109s appeared in five different liveries. With the coming of the New Haven’s EMD FL9s in the late 1950s, the veteran DL109s days were numbered and the DL109s service on the NYNH&amp;H ended in July 1959. Over their 15-year careers, the New Haven DL109s had indeed hauled premier varnish, secondary passenger trains, mail, freight, and even commuters.<br><br>The New Haven Alco DL109 for Train Simulator is a truly remarkable add-on that features the pioneering Alco in exacting detail, wearing five authentic liveries, and accompanied by a superb set of New Haven’s beautiful postwar streamlined passenger cars. A selection of five career scenarios for the New Haven Springfield Line route (route available separately) put the iconic Alco right to work in realistic and challenging settings. <br><br>Take the throttle of a pioneering, and stylish, American diesel locomotive – with the New Haven Alco DL109 for Train Simulator!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>Five career scenarios featuring the New Haven Alco DL109 on the Train Simulator Springfield Line: Springfield – New Haven Route are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[DL-109] NH Train #67, The Bankers<br><\/li><li>[DL-109] NH Train #80, The Connecticut Yankee<br><\/li><li>[DL-109] Hartford-Cedar Hill Priority Freight<br><\/li><li>[DL-109] Hartford-Springfield Freight<br><\/li><li>[DL-109] Springfield-Boston Mail<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/325992\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Springfield Line: Springfield – New Haven Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
