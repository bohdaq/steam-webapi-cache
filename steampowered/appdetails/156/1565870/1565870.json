After my friends and I had some fun matches in a similar minigame back then, I thought it would be fun to have it a bit faster and more maps.

The base layer is a PNG file containing the stage colliders. Every part of the image that is not white will be seen as a collider. The background should be white or transparent. The next layer is a JSON file for advanced map options to move and rotate goals, move player or ball spawn points. Custom maps must be stored in &quot;%userprofile%\/Appdata\/LocalLow\/Beardman Studios\/fightforthatball\/CustomMaps\/&quot;. Fight for that Ball comes with a custom map guide. You can find all files in the custom maps directory under CustomMapGuide. Both files must have the same name, E.g. test.png and test.json. The JSON file is not required. The game would load the default positions for goals and spawn points if no JSON file was found.<br><br>Stay safe! &lt;3","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT FOR THAT BALL<\/h2><br>A minimalistic football fighting 2D platformer with extensive custom maps support.
