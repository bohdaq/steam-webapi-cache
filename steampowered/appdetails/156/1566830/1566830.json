In this game, you have to transform a lonely house into a charming hamlet by placing your buildings strategically, raising their level, receiving various adjacency bonuses, and expanding your territory. Magna Graecia is suitable for both who want to relax, slowly filling their village with olives and grapes, and those who want to test their strategic thinking because every <strong>ill-conceived building can be one of the last<\/strong> in your Greek village.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1566830\/extras\/IMG2_ENG.jpg?t=1653485218\" \/><br><br>You start the game with one house in the center and six empty hexagonal tiles around it, which you have to fill using a randomly generated sequence of buildings and resources: crop field, winery, forest, and so on, gaining points along the way. To <strong>expand<\/strong> your village, you need to build a house that adds all adjacent tiles to the territory of the Greek hamlet. In this game, you can (and should!) <strong>level up<\/strong> houses, wineries, and olive farms. Leveling up mechanics are simple: 3 same first-level buildings, where each is adjacent to the other two, turn into one second-level building, which gives you amazing bonuses. For example, a second-level house adds all adjacent tiles in a radius of 2 to the village (the radius is doubled). The game ends when the limit on houses is exhausted and all tiles in your village are filled with buildings and resources.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1566830\/extras\/IMG3_ENG.jpg?t=1653485218\" \/><br><br>There are two key resources in the game – <strong>olives<\/strong> and <strong>grapes<\/strong>. We can say that this is the real pride of your Greek hamlet. You should place olives and grapes on the adjacent tiles to olive farms and wineries respectively because <strong>adjacency bonuses<\/strong> play a very important role here: each resource gives +1 by default, and for each farm adjacent to it, this indicator increases by 1. Farms level up the same way as houses. Their radius of influence and adjacency bonuses will be doubled (now +2!), significantly increasing production in the village. Remember, that's a very powerful tool. By placing buildings correctly, you will literally become an olive oil and wine tycoon, thereby adding a lot of points to the <strong>overall rating<\/strong> of your village, which will show at the end of the game, how well you did in creating a Greek farming village.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1566830\/extras\/IMG4_ENG.jpg?t=1653485218\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magna Graecia <strong>offers<\/strong> you:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Evaluating different options.<\/strong> Should I place it here?
