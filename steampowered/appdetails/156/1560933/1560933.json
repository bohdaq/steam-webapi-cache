With the new Chessie System came the railroad’s vibrant and now iconic livery featuring the silhouette of C&amp;O’s famed “Chessie the Kitten” and brilliant yellow, vermillion, and blue colors.   And now, you can experience the classic and captivating era of the famed Chessie System as authentically re-created for the popular Train Simulator CSX Hanover Subdivision route!<br><br>The Chessie System Retro Pack, developed by High Iron Simulations, includes everything you need to step back in time to the 1970s and early 1980s and go to work for the famed railroad that was a key predecessor of today’s giant CSX Transportation.<br><br>The Chessie System Retro Pack includes three types of Electro-Motive diesel locomotives – the GP9 and GP35 road-switcher, as well as the “SW-series” switcher, the latter in three model variations (SW7, SW9, and SW1200).

The freight equipment wears a variety of Chessie System, Western Maryland, Baltimore &amp; Ohio, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, and generic liveries.<br><br>Created to bring the Chessie System era to full life on the highly acclaimed CSX Hanover Subdivision route (which became part of the Chessie System along with the rest of the Western Maryland in 1973) the retro pack includes a selection of nine realistic career scenarios based on actual operations and train symbols.<br><br>Note: The locomotives and freight equipment included in the Chessie System Retro Pack can be realistically used on a variety of Train Simulator route; use of the included scenarios requires the CSX Hanover Subdivision route (route available separately).<br><br>Take the throttle of the Chessie System’s magnificent and diverse motive power and enjoy classic railroading amid the historic farmlands and scenic mountains of Maryland and Pennsylvania – with the Chessie System Retro Pack for Train Simulator!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>Nine realistic and challenging career scenarios appropriate to the Chessie System era are included, putting you at the throttle of diverse motive power for mainline, local, and switching operations on the Train Simulator CSX Hanover Subdivision route:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[CSR 1.01] Chessie Comes to Hagerstown<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.02] Chessie Symbol WM-6<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.03] Working Westward<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.04] Gathering the Granules<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.05] Hanover Visitor<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.06] Something Borrowed, Something Blue<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.07] Chessie Symbol BH-1, Part 1<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.08] Chessie Symbol BH-1, Part 2<br><\/li><li>[CSR 1.09] Bittinger Afternoon Call<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1267509\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >CSX Hanover Subdivision: Hanover - Hagerstown Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
