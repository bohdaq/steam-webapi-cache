The student is often limited to a single unrealistic school room area that remains static and suffers from bottlenecked availability.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nForensic EduSim™ resolves these issues by creating ultra-realistic graphics and textured environments, customizable props, and realistic flesh wounds as forensic crime investigators would experience in real life.
