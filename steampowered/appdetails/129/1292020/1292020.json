The game features over 50 campaigns set between 1939 and 1945, and over 500 unit types. The terrain map for each combat day and the types of enemies you encounter are randomly and procedurally generated, which means that each playthrough of a campaign will bring new and unexpected challenges.

You will frequently find yourself outnumbered and outgunned. Your success in a campaign will depend on your ability to deal with a variety of challenges, and to make best use of all the tactics and tools that you have at your disposal.

Despite being attributable to wargames and in particular to simulations, Armored Commander II is a practically unique product of its kind.
