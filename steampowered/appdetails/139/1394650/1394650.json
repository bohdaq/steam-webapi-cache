Your journey will see you making valuable allies and powerful enemies, exploring a decaying urban jungle ruled by gangs that all want you dead, and customizing your skills and equipment to become the ultimate force of vengeance—all while uncovering a vast conspiracy that could alter the course of the city's future.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features<\/h2><br><strong>Explosive Combat<\/strong><br><br>Play as a badass schoolgirl able to hold her own against hordes of violent foes.

No two in-game days ever need to be the same.<br><br><strong>A Fully Interactive World<\/strong><br><br>Control a day\/night cycle that takes the city from bustling mornings to a pulse-pounding nightlife scene. Personalize your home with a diverse assortment of interactable objects. <br><br>Craft your own weapons and accessories from materials, then customize their attributes with collectable stickers and mod parts. Recruit NPCs to help you take on challenging Raid Stages—or ignore your enemies and assault pedestrians!
