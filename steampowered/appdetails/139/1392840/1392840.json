It’s your choice.<\/li><\/ul>Once you’ve found the <strong>ancient temple<\/strong> that holds the relic, you can go there and grab it in a daring raid as you evade and defeat a variety of security systems.

These ancient complexes aren’t about finding a relic - just about getting rich. Complexes are procedurally-generated and contain a wide variety of threats. The threats are designed to interact with each other and even be useful - You can intentionally wake sleeping ancient soldiers to help fight pirates who followed you to the complex, or ignite an ancient fuel node to burn out giant insects nesting in the next room. It can get pretty crazy - this is RimWorld, after all.<br><br><strong>New temporary encampments<\/strong> will set up near your colony. These small communities are lightly-defended and often not associated with any larger faction, making them good targets if you want to become a raider yourself. Beliefs matter - If your beliefs are aggressive, your colonists may even demand this kind of attack be carried out regularly to satisfy their need for dominance. The encampments vary from farms to logging sites, mines, and hunting lodges, each with different kinds of defenders and loot.<br><br>Groups of <strong>beggars<\/strong> will arrive and ask for aid. Help them, and they might reward you later. You can also choose to betray them and enslave them, recruit them, sell them, or anything else.

These ancient complexes aren’t about finding a relic - just about getting rich. Complexes are procedurally-generated and contain a wide variety of threats. The threats are designed to interact with each other and even be useful - You can intentionally wake sleeping ancient soldiers to help fight pirates who followed you to the complex, or ignite an ancient fuel node to burn out giant insects nesting in the next room. It can get pretty crazy - this is RimWorld, after all.<br><br><strong>New temporary encampments<\/strong> will set up near your colony. These small communities are lightly-defended and often not associated with any larger faction, making them good targets if you want to become a raider yourself. Beliefs matter - If your beliefs are aggressive, your colonists may even demand this kind of attack be carried out regularly to satisfy their need for dominance. The encampments vary from farms to logging sites, mines, and hunting lodges, each with different kinds of defenders and loot.<br><br>Groups of <strong>beggars<\/strong> will arrive and ask for aid. Help them, and they might reward you later. You can also choose to betray them and enslave them, recruit them, sell them, or anything else.
