Go it alone or work together with friends in this intense and challenging arena shooter! And of course no game show would be complete without announcers commentating on all of the action- Last Shot is hosted by none other than Spectre-473 from Zeta-Reticuli and Skashkar, the Conqueror of Worlds, who will give you play-by-play commentary on all of the chaos and destruction!<br> <br>Along with grindable challenges, dozens of customizable characters and weapons, thousands of attachments, abilities to master, and over 20 competitive game modes, Last Shot offers a variety of both symmetrical and asymmetrical maps, each with its own unique setting, tactical vantage points, and play style.
