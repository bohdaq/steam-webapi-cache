is an action game in which players assume the role of a Valkyrie tasked with finding and purifying lost souls. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments and battle monsters, fellow Valkyries, and boss characters. Players use melee weapons (e.g., swords, spears) and elemental attacks (e.g., blasts of fire) to kill enemies in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by impact sounds, cries of pain, and explosions. One sequence depicts a character dramatically impaled by a spear. The word “sh*t” appears in the game."}}}}
