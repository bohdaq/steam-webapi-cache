I am the head writer, sole programmer, and director of Siren’s Call. As a native Floridian, I put a lot of myself into this game, but always viewed it as more of a personal project to help me make sense of the world rather than anything other people would actually be interested in. <br><br>I have never been happier in my life to be wrong. The fact people have found value in this little VN of ours means more than I can even begin to articulate, and I hope your experience with it either has or proves to be worthwhile. <br><br>While Siren’s Call is free and always will be, you can support our team by buying this fan pack! It has 13 HQ wallpapers, 30+ original songs composed just for this game (7 of which were unused in the game itself), a development booklet highlighting how all this came to be, and a spin-off 30,000+ word short story written by my co-writer (and best friend) Cory Nungesser.<br><br>You also have my eternal gratitude. Support like this will help us make more games in the Siren’s Call universe, so it is very, very appreciated. <br><br><strong>Siren’s Call Development Booklet:<\/strong><br><br>This is a digital booklet that contains both concept art and my personal notes on what inspired the creation of Siren’s Call.

If you wanted something a little lighter after the intensity of Siren’s Call itself, this is the perfect pallet cleanser. You also get to see Cory’s take on these characters as well, which is a cool thing by itself. <br><br>You can access all of these by going into Siren’s Call’s Properties after downloading and clicking the “Browse Local Files” button.
