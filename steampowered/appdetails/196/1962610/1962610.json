Each round you will draw 5 cards and will have 3 immersion to use. Each card in your hand costs an amount of immersion to played and provides some effect in the ordeal. Either providing Confidence to avoid Anxiety, or by interpreting the Torment you're facing. An interpreted Torment is overcome and removed from the ordeal.
