{"1961500":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Nosy Little Fly","steam_appid":1961500,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Nosy Little Fly is a funny 2D side scroller with an unique movement mechanic. Instead of moving sideways as usual, you can add force to your character in any direction. You must manage you inertia in order to finish the levels. It is a challenge to your motor skills, filled with humor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAccelerating, making turns and stopping are all done by controlling the torque of your character. It can be difficult at first, but very rewarding to master. Before you know it, you'll be zipping through the levels like nothing else!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe level design is mostly linear and short, so that you can have both quick and long play sessions. In that sense, it is a casual experience. However, the physics-based movement and single-touch death mechanics bring a hardcore twist to the game. But don't worry, there is no pesky lives \/ continues system here.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you get stuck in a particular stage, no problem, as levels are unlocked in batches, so that you can take on them in any order you like. You are not required to beat each and every one of them to gain access to the next batch, either. Just collect enough stars in your favorite courses, and you're good to go.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSpeaking of unlocking, there are dozens of cosmetic unlockables to attain. Caps, wigs, glasses and much more can decorate your character on the screen. Just gather enough coins and trade for them in the skin select menu.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut not all visual changes are merely cosmetic, no. There are character variations to get as well, each with an unique special ability! Locate stars easier with the explorer fly, take one hit and stay alive with the knight, or have an easier experience with the baby fly. You name it, these characters are here to add variety to the experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo sum it up, Nosy Little Fly is different to most side scrollers. It is a challenge to hardcore 2D gamers to master, and a funny endeavor for casuals to take on. Whatever player type you are, there is a lot of fun for you here.","about_the_game":"Nosy Little Fly is a funny 2D side scroller with an unique movement mechanic.
