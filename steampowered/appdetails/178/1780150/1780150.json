{"1780150":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Maze Mayhem","steam_appid":1780150,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<h1>An update for the big update in progress<\/h1><p>So I haven't made an official update in a while which is why I am now making this update.  While this is taking longer than I expected, I have made progress.  As of right now, I am in the quality assurance status.  I have rebuilt the game from the inside out to make it function more smoothly.  In addition to this, I have also updated and rebalanced some levels to match the changes I have made including rebuilding some levels from the ground up.  In addition to this, I have remastered about half of the songs for stereo quality.  In order to finish the update, I must finish my QA on the rest of the music, sound balancing, and story update for the first half of the game.  After this is done, all I need to do is make a demo build for those who wish to try the game before they buy it and I will be ready to release my update.  For all those who are following along with the updates (as few as they may be), I appreciate your patience.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>ARE you burnt out on massive games that requires hours upon days to finish, let alone complete?\r\nDO you find yourself enjoying simple, yet deceptively challenging games?\r\nIS a third question even required at this point?  Because all the answers are conveniently the same!\r\n\r\n     Welcome to my game, Maze Mayhem!  This game is jam-packed with 50 levels full of variety.  From puzzle solving, to dodging enemies, to avoiding spikes, to dancing around fire, to enemies dancing around you, and plenty of mazes to navigate. Trust and believe me when I say that you are sure to find something new around every level.  And with levels being about a few minutes long to finish (assuming everything goes fine), it's an easy game to play for a few minutes. . .Or maybe even a few hours, who knows.\r\n\r\n     I know someone who will know, the game master.  He will be with you throughout your journey in this game.  Observing you.  Taking notes on what you do, what you say, and how you perform.  And after specified milestones, he gets to have a chat with you about it all.  But his favorite part?  Seeing someone attempting to make their way through his mazes and enjoying the fruits of his labor.  So what are you waiting for?  Come challenge my Mazes of Mayhem today!","about_the_game":"ARE you burnt out on massive games that requires hours upon days to finish, let alone complete?<br \/>\r\nDO you find yourself enjoying simple, yet deceptively challenging games?<br \/>\r\nIS a third question even required at this point?
