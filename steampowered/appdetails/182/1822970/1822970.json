Shadowgate VR is an important step for the franchise. It preserves the soul of the original, but modernizes it for a whole new audience. This first chapter is a taste of things to come, and I’m excited for it.”<br>90 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/gamingtrend.com\/feature\/reviews\/shadowgate-vr-the-mines-of-mythrok-review-delve-deeply\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Trend<\/a><br><br>“Overall, the first chapter comes together as a wonderfully fun and exciting dungeon crawler. Shadowgate is a superior first VR effort from the Zojoi team. They have struck an engaging balance between the roots of the game, the tropes of the fantasy genre, and the spatial and immersion possibilities that VR offers for gaming. Hopefully, there will be more VR chapters of the Shadowgate saga to enjoy in the future.”<br>85 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/cogconnected.com\/review\/shadowgate-the-mines-of-mythrok-vr-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >COGconnected<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1822970\/header.jpg?t=1655473814","website":"https:\/\/www.zojoi.com\/shadowgate-vr\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> i5-6600K equivalent or better<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 equivalent or better<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 4 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"(c) 2022 Zojoi, LLC.
