It's going to happen, eventually. \r\nNever the less, that doesn't mean you can't have a long and productive life in space, with a little help from technology.\r\n\r\nAlthough, we're nearly ready to give everyone the chance to critique all our hard work, there are a few mechanics still needing some extra attention to catch up with the rest of the class.\r\n\r\n* Building additional hub for your station still not implemented. \r\n* Tutorials for Researching new items to craft.  \r\n* Replacing and Tweaking Animations.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n* Occasionally, animation resets when mining ore back to Zero G animation. \r\n\r\nComing Soon:\r\n* Space Station Hubs:  Build and add to your Station. \r\n* More Craftables:   Make your station a home and craft furniture and more. \r\n* Station arcade:  Space can be boring luckily you have your stations computer to play games on.
