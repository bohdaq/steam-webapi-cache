When he reached out to me about making silly music inspired by Snipperclips and Yoshi music, I had to jump on this project.  I wanted to find a vibe that was both relaxing enough to focus on hitting hard jumps, but also driving enough to inspire progression.  A lot of the hip-hop\/boom-bap inspired tempos helped solidify that feel.  I loved using toybox sounds, wacky versions of medieval instruments, as well as creating rubber band samples and plucky synths from scratch.
