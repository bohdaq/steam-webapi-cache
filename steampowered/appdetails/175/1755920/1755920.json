Different forces strike to make their own way in the world and desire the control of the Lagrange system.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou, emerging as one of the force leaders, find yourself in a time of challenges and opportunities.

Are you determined to achieve something great out there or go back to the safety of home? <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom 0 to Infitnite<br \/>\r\nInto the unknown galaxy, you have only a small city with two frigate. Through mining, building and trade, expand your base and territory, attain better ship-building technology and carry more weight in the intergalactic space.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCustomized Weapon System<br \/>\r\nYou may even modify and upgrade the weapon system on every single ship, if you ever want to tap into your creative side.
