of the Spear: Task Force Elite contains spurts of blood when players are shot or stabbed. The spurts of blood are not especially realistic, but they tend to be large. Blood does not splatter onto walls. \r\n\r\nMild shouts of pain\/agony occur when players are shot, but the shouting is not extreme or realistic. \r\n\r\nThe game does NOT feature \"gibbing\" or dismemberment. Some death animations tend to be realistic, while others are ragdoll.\r\n\r\nOnline player interaction, including text and voice chat, may include profanity. Some lines of character dialogue may also contain profanity."}}}}
