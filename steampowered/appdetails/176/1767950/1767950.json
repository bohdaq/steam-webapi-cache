{"1767950":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Slime Dice","steam_appid":1767950,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Roll Dice! Make Characters! Play Mini-games &amp; Strategize Combat! Gather a team of your very own characters and defeat the monsters of Spegroon. Slime Dice is based heavily on both 2000's era video games and board games. Combat itself also offers many decisions, both when creating your team, and while in battle. Roll dice to get special combos, or go for another strategy entirely!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCharacter Creation is where you'll start the game, making your own character first. You can change the visuals, the voice, and even their default emotions! After that, you pick their stats. There are four different stats to invest into, and a large amount of abilities to select from. Mixing and matching these abilities, stats, and equipment is a big part of the game! Do this not only for this character, but up to a total of eight! Will you make a party of mages? Perhaps a pirate crew, wielding flintlocks and axes? Or, will you make a team based on characters from your favorite game\/series? The choice is yours!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMinigames are a small but important part of the game. There are a variety of minigames, and you'll end up playing one before combat! From Snake to Sliders, there's all sorts of minigames. Playing and mastering them will grant you attack bonuses in combat, which can turn the tide, and let you come out with a win.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAttacking consists of dice rolls and strategic action. Instead of just rolling one die for attacks and using that, however, you instead roll three dice. After the roll is done, you can select what dice to keep and what to reroll. This not only lets you manage the risk\/reward, but it also combos well with the various traits your weapons will have. Certain weapons have specials that can be rolled, such as Smashing, which activates when rolling all even numbers, and adds the dice to the damage! Or Slashing, where rolling a straight will get a guaranteed 10 damage, even if you miss! And the everpresent Bunko, which will always hit and deal double the damage. Deciding what dice to reroll isn't a simple action, but something that alone adds a ton of depth, while remaining fairly simple.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCombat builds on this theme of options. For example, unlike most RPGs, you have a variety of defensive options. You can defend the next attack, defend a certain unit, or even move what row you're in. You have a Front Row and a Back Row, and so does your enemy. Melee in front and Ranged in back, however, lose your front line, and the back fall to the front! Units in the back are also defended by the front ones, so you build defense not only in your actions, but also your team composition. Spells, Skills, and a variety of other mechanics keep gameplay interesting &amp; exciting far after your first slime!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis game is in active development, and updates will be released iteratively, far more than how most games are made. Stay tuned to see what we come out with next!","about_the_game":"Roll Dice! Make Characters! Play Mini-games &amp; Strategize Combat!
