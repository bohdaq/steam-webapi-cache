You have to send your scouts to different regions in order to uncover the best talent. Your scouts become more effective and improve over time. They regularly send you information (about potential, characteristics, etc.) which you use to make your choices (observation, integration in the development team, etc.) so you can learn more about the riders. You are, of course, in direct competition with the other teams. <br><br><strong>NEW GENERATION OF RIDERS<\/strong><br>This new system is based on the level and potential of the young cyclists, using a 6-star grading system. Now the young riders who are created are juniors from 16 to 18 years old, with the pool comprised of 1,500 to 2,000 young cyclists each year (3 times more than before). These new riders will be more versatile and will develop similarly to the current stars. <br><br><strong>RIDER DEVELOPMENT<\/strong><br>Just like with the young talent, we want to have more versatile riders, so the development system has been redesigned to take this into account.

This allows some riders to attack several times or manage their effort at the end of the race better.<br>The race-day condition is now closer to the announced provisional condition. To enable comprehensive customisation, you can now adjust 2 parameters: bonus amplitude (from +5 to -5 or complete deactivation) and activation or deactivation of variation.<br>The simulation time has been optimised and is now twice as fast as before. <br>You can now have specific team jerseys for a given race.","about_the_game":"Pro Cycling Manager 2022 makes you a sport director.
