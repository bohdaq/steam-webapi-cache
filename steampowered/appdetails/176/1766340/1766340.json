{"1766340":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Professor of Magical Studies","steam_appid":1766340,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Professor of Magical Studies is an interactive magical school novel by Stephen Granade, where your choices control the story. It’s entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou’re a professor of magical studies, specializing in pattern magic. When magical practitioners study special patterns, they reshape their minds to turn the potential energy between dimensions into magical energy and shape the world to their will.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are risks, of course. Practitioners are configuring their minds in non-human ways, and there’s a limit to how much your mind can bounce back from that. Then there are the self-aware, intelligent creatures in other dimensions who can also perform magic. Sometimes, when you channel magic, one of these creatures can cross over and takes up residence in the practitioner’s mind...your mind. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut the risks are worth it. You’ve been invited to join the faculty at Winfield Phillips College as a last-minute hire to replace a vanished professor. Winfield Phillips doesn’t have a graduate program, but it does have sharp undergrads who are natural fodder for your research. Now you have to balance your own magical research with a teaching load, your students’ needs, and your goal to become the youngest tenured faculty member the Winfield Phillips has ever had. That’s assuming you don’t give up and go work for Repro, the company that would love to have your magic research. Oh, and then there’s the Vastness, and those incomprehensible cross-dimensional beings who are drawn to magic use and who might just destroy the Earth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll in a day’s work for Winfield Phillips’s most junior magical faculty member.","about_the_game":"Professor of Magical Studies is an interactive magical school novel by Stephen Granade, where your choices control the story.
