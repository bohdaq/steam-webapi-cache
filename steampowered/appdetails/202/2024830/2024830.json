Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head"}}}}
