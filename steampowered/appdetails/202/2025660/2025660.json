Each player will have resources represented by cards which each player will use to defend or destroy the town. Over five rounds, players will vote on who will go on guard against the incoming wolf attacks. Those who do not guard and stay in town will choose from a variety of actions to gain extra cards or vital intel.<br><br>The game ends and the Werebunnies win if, at the end of any round, the defenses - the Wall and the Tower - drop to zero. The Townsfolk win if they manage to defend the town through to the final night with at least 1 point of defenses remaining. The Townsfolk can also win if at any time they unanimously accuse the correct two players of being Werebunnies.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY<\/strong><br>The game is played over five rounds, indicated by the phases of the moon. Each round has a day phase in which all players are together and then a night phase in which players are separated into two teams, each with their own separate voice channel for communication.<br><br>The defenses are attacked by the wolves lurking in the forest surrounding the town, and true Townsfolk will try to bolster the defenses with cards that are worth 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. Meanwhile, the Werebunnies will secretly use those same cards to weaken the defenses instead. All players start the game with three cards in hand, and can gain more over the course of the game; both Townsfolk and Werebunnies can play as many cards as they want on a single night on guard, but must consider if they want to save cards for later nights as well.<br><br><strong>ACTIONS<\/strong><br>Each time you stay at home, no matter what action you take, you will gain one card at the end of the night. You can also gain cards at home by Blessing another player also at home to grant them an additional card, or Predicting if the defenses will take damage that night, and if you’re correct, gaining an additional card.<br><br><strong>SABOTAGE<\/strong><br>Werebunnies have the extra, powerful, option to Sabotage each night that they are at home. They can pick any player (even the same player!), regardless of whether that player is at home or on guard at the Tower, and try to guess that player’s Quirk. If the Werebunnies are correct, then that player will lose their Item at the end of the night, and both Werebunnies will gain an additional card!<br><br><strong>QUIRKS<\/strong><br>Quirks are attributes that Townsfolk have that affect their ability to play or win the game. A Townsfolk must meet the requirements of their Quirk to be considered a winner at the end of the game. In other words – if the game ends in a Townsfolk victory and you have not completed your Quirk, you are not invited to the party!<br><br><strong>ITEMS<\/strong><br>Items offer benefits and abilities that, if used well, give Townsfolk and Werebunnies small advantages in the game: revealing more information, gaining more cards, or helping you protect the town more effectively. There are currently five Items, and you have an equal chance of being offered any of them at the start – with the exception of the Mystical Recipe, which is much more rare, and can only appear up to one time at the start of every game.<br><br><strong>MUTATIONS<\/strong><br>Mutations are powerful attributes that allow Werebunnies unique paths to victory and sneaky ways to outwit Townsfolk players – like damaging the defenses when they’re not even on guard that night, or gaining an extra card if they can trick a Townsfolk into Blessing them.<br><br><strong>ACCUSE<\/strong><br>The Townsfolk have one final path to victory: Accusing. Townsfolk can, at any point, choose to Accuse two other players of being Werebunnies. If, at the end of any phase, ALL Townsfolk have correctly chosen BOTH Werebunnies, the game will immediately end with a Townsfolk victory – regardless of the damage to the town, and whether or not Townsfolk have fulfilled their Quirks.
