This is either due to their large scope being beyond the capabilities of our small development team, or because they don't fit with the core gameplay.<br><br>As well, for the same reasons, some common features of 4x and strategy games in general won't be coming to Critias Empire. Below are some of the features we've decided not to pursue for now:<br><br>Multiple Gods<br>- We would love to implement multiple Gods, each with their own unique disasters. Afterall, the Greek Gods were a whole pantheion of personalities. However it would be impractical to implement, for both technical and scope reasons. <br><br>Different Disasters<br>- Fires, volcanoes, lightning bolts thrown from the very hand of Zeus - Different types of disaster, each with its own set of challenges and rewards are a natural fit for extending Critias Empire. However due to very specific technical reasons around how terrain is generated in Critias Empire, it is sadly not possible to implement.<br><br>AI Competitors<br>- It was decided right from the start of development that other competing civilisations or nations would massively increase the scope of the game. Far beyond what our small team can hope to make. To put it another way, cutting them has also cut out whole parts of the traditional strategy genre, such as units, combat and diplomacy. This has allowed us to focus on making the challenge of surviving and adapting to the disasters and ever-changing map from an intriguing idea into what we feel is an exciting game in its own right.<br><br>Exploration<br>- In place of AI Competitors putting external pressure on the player, Critias Empire instead has it's deity-driven disasters, and a relatively small map. Unfortunately, in this context, typical 4x style exploration does not make sense, and trying to re-invent exploration is a mammoth, risky task best left for another game entirely.<br><br>Factions<br>- Perhaps the ancient Atlanteans were in fact cultural brethren of the Persians, Carthaginians or Celts? It would be cool to play as different factions based on ancient Mediterranean cultures, each with thier own unique stats, bonuses and buildings. However, it would also massively increase the scope of the game, especially in terms of art, beyond what our team can implement.<br><br>Story-Arc<br>- The legend of Atlantis, as originally orated by Critias and written down by Plato, is only partially complete. The rest of the story has been lost in the mists of time. Filling it back in with a grand story arc for the main game, or campign made of multiple missions is unfortunately a vast undertaking in technical and narrative writing terms, and sadly not something we can reasonably do, given our limited resources.","about_the_game":"Critias Empire is a turn based strategy game that mixes elements of 4x and city builder genres.
