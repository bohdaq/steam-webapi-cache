Eventually numbering 260 members, the D series locomotives were constructed by both the Victorian Railways and outside locomotive builders, including the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, the Baldwin Locomotive works in the USA, and others. Over time, many of the class were rebuilt or modified with superheaters, larger cylinders, and larger boilers, which in turn lead to the introduction of sub classes, these being D1 (original DD class locomotives), D2 (superheated, with larger cylinders), and D3 (larger superheated boiler and electric lighting).<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>VR Dd Class - T2 - 2 Tone Green (VR DD T2 Grn)<br><\/li><li>VR Dd Class - T2 - Canadian Red (VR DD T2 Can Red)<br><\/li><li>VR Dd Class - T2 - World War 1 Red (VR DD T2 WW1)<br><\/li><li>VR Dd Class - T2 - Black, single compressor ( VR DD T2 Black)<br><\/li><li>VR Dd Class - T2 - Black, twin compressors (VR DD T2 Black2)<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Features include:<\/strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5 locomotives, in 5 liveries, in broad gauge and standard gauge (10 locomotives total)<br><\/li><li>Each livery has its own weathering, and detail differences as necessary<br><\/li><li>Full LOD on main meshes and bogies<br><\/li><li>Scripted exhaust smoke effects, based off regulator and cut-off<br><\/li><li>Scripted and animated air compressor, with sound and smoke effects<br><\/li><li>Scripted steam and sound effects including injectors, and blower<br><\/li><li>Animated screwlink couplers, brake hoses\/taps, and safety chains using ACS<br><\/li><li>Scripted Marker Lamps and Tail discs, with glow lamps (thanks to Bloodnok for the script for this function) - compatible with the VR Set Train Lamps driver command<br><\/li><li>Animated cab windows, cab roof vent, weather tarp, smokebox door, and tender tank filler lid<br><\/li><li>Full custom interior view, with operational controls<br><\/li><li>Physique based coal load animation in tender, giving realistic deformation as coal is used<br><\/li><li>Automatic Numbering Script, with automatic tender numbering<br><\/li><li>Snow mesh, using the snow altitude function in Trainz<\/li><\/ul> <br><strong>Additional features in TANE:<\/strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Scripted Cylinder Drain Effects based on steam chest pressure<br><\/li><li>Window and roof vent controls in cab view control windows and roof vent in exterior view<br><\/li><li>Weather tarp in cab view matches exterior view<br><\/li><li>Normals map\/tbumpenv number plates<br><\/li><li>Free Roam session populated with passenger and goods rolling stock<br><\/li><li>Uses TANE auto numbering system<br><\/li><li>Wethering in cab views<br><\/li><li>Improved script for main smoke effect<br><\/li><li>Improved colours on red locomotives<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"Constructed between 1903 and 1920, the Victorian Railways DD class locomotive was designed as a mixed traffic locomotive, with capabilities of also hauling mainline passenger services.
