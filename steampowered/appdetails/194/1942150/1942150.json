Like in the Grimms' Fairy Tales, some are brutal and outspoken. Among the fantasy and adventures, there are hints of harsh language, violence and sexuality. \r\n\r\nNone of the stories include any kind of negative depiction or mistreatment of certain people or cultures. Even though we Finns can sometimes laugh at ourselves. \r\n\r\n"}}}}
