As a 'Purger,' you must watch the other players to see if they display suspicious activity. Depending on the play style of the Demon, this will either be easy or very difficult. Thankfully, there are some tools the player can use to help them. Each player has the ability to search other players' inventory. A player can go up to another player and request to see their inventory, and a player can accept or decline this request. Since Demons have access to hidden items such as Demon Books, or the ability to steal other players' items, it's an excellent tool to use against suspicious players. <br><br><strong>Figuring Out The Demon Type<\/strong><br>Spread out randomly throughout the environment, at the start of each match; there will be 'Paranormal Zones' in which the Demon and Human Realm are starting to combine, allowing paranormal activity to occur. With this activity occurring, you will use specialized equipment to collect data points. For example, one of the devices you can use is called a 'ParaMeter' which records E.M.F (Electronic Magnetic Fields) and temperature readings. You will use this device to get a specific reading, then use this data point and compare it with the Demon Database to filter down the demon type.<br><br>Accompanying your equipment, you also have your senses to collect data points: your sense of smell and your current emotional state. <br><br>But you have to work fast, as these zones spawn randomly and are only around for a limited amount of time.<br><br><strong>Name Of The Demon<\/strong><br>Spread throughout the environment, letters of the alphabet will spawn periodically to help the player figure out the Demon's name. The player can also use one of the equipment tools called a 'Ghost Box' to reveal more of these hidden letters, aiding you in uncovering the Demon's name. <br><br><strong>Threats<\/strong><br>Not only do the Purgers have to watch out for the 'Demon,' but there will be multiple A.I. threats in the environment that can attack them; this includes 'Shadow People.' These entities are from the Shadow Realm and are determined to bring the Purgers back to the Shadow Realm. To protect yourself against the 'Shadow People,' you must be in the zone of a U.V.E.D. The U.V.E.D is an item you can use inside the game. <br><br>The Demon, however, is immune to these threats. <br><br><strong>Life After Death<\/strong><br>If you happen to fall victim to one of the threats, don't worry, you are not out of the game. You will enter 'Ghost Mode' in which you have a separate mechanic to win the match. Randomly spawned across the environment will be 10 hidden 'Sacred Pages' you will need to collect and turn in. If you find all 10 pages and turn them in, the 'Purgers' win! But these pages will be difficult to acquire and don't spawn in often.","about_the_game":"Masks of Deception is a 6 player multiplayer game where you must work together to find and expel a demon.
