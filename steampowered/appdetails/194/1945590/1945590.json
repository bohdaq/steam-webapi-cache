If you are a beginner we predict you'll need about 10 hours of in-game experience before you are able to complete it.<br><br>Linguist FPS is a roguelike style game and it is expected that you will die a lot (especially at first). As your language skills improve, it will gradually become easier to access weapons, armor and health.
