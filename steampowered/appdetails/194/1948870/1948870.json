It's also rare to find those games with full audio dialogue transcribed into other languages. Pierre's Adventures uses simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. That said, we would recommend that you try playing some of your favorite RPGs in French. If you are able to understand all your objectives then congratulations! Your French is already quite excellent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Everything is in French without translation? Won't I feel overwhelmed?&quot;<\/h2>Sometimes, yes! But don't be discouraged, you can absolutely complete this game even if you don't understand every word that's being said. If you can persevere you'll find that you're still able to understand your objectives and how to achieve them. New language learners often find themselves quite overwhelmed when first attempting to interact in the language they’re studying. This is a natural part of the process.
