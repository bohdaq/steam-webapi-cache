The rescue operation goes awry, and you are left stranded and alone on the derelict ship. Searching below deck you find no sign of life. The crew appears to have just vanished; replaced with eerie stone statues, but perhaps you're not as alone as you first thought. Explore the derelict ship to uncover what happened 4 years ago and what fate befell the crew.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLazaret is a first-person horror game with light puzzle elements and an emphasis on atmosphere. You play as a lone member of a rescue crew who must complete puzzles and explore the derelict ship while trying to avoid meeting the same fate as the missing crew. Danger lurks around every corner - you must run or hide to stay alive as you learn more about the ship and what caused its mysterious disappearance 4 years ago.","about_the_game":"A rescue team is called out to investigate a distress signal coming from a ship identified as the MTS Endurance - a ship known to have disappeared 4 years ago on a voyage across the Atlantic.
