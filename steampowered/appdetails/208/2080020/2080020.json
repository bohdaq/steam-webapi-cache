You were the leading scientist of the Sigil Corporation's Reactor Project, but when you learned that their goal was not for the betterment of mankind you decided to leave and make yourself vanish. The agencies of Sigil Corp have no idea where you've gone and now this is your opportunity to make the Reactor a reality and share your technology with the world. Your new home is terribly polluted though and first you need to clean it up. Build your home estate how you want, earn income in numerous ways, from planting crops, establishing farms, or making computer games. When you are ready you will establish your reactor and work towards transforming your world for the better.<br><br>Home By The River is a 2D side scroller world building game where you can place or remove tiles in the game world. It is a type of sandbox but with a focus on the primary objective of the game which is to establish the reactor and then help the whole world prosper in a way never seen before.<br><br>You start the game with a polluted land by the river and you have to clean it up by removing the dead trees, old wrecked structures and planting new trees. As your trees start to grow they will reduce the pollution in your environment and you will see the world change. You can plant three types of crop; corn, wheat, and sugar based on your level and you will see them grow. If you harvest them when mature you will receive the relevant commodity. You need lots of money to establish your reactor and you can earn by selling commodities to the river men passing by or through a trading terminal when you are higher level. You can also engage in other activities to earn money such as developing computer games, unlocking passive businesses in the background, placing solar panels, etc.<br><br>As you build your house, grow trees and crops you'll level up and unlock a new set of tiles to place in the world. You have stats; energy, hunger, spirit, virtue, money which you need to look after. There is a day night cycle and so the world changes appearance constantly as per the time of day. You need money to keep on building and to establish your reactor. This is a relaxing game overall but you can lose the game if you starve or remain without spirit for too long.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Dev<\/h2>My objective as the developer is to give you an environment that you can make beautiful and relax in. Home By The River is being developed by one person, Looqmaan aka Gamer To Game Developer, and it is the most meaningful game to me that I have ever worked on, and a full time job for me. I'm looking forward to continue updating this for years to come. I've been making games and teaching game development for ten years.<br><br>If you're interested in developing your own games then you may be interested in my Gamer To Game Developer Series 2.
