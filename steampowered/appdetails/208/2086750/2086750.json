The foundation of this is fairly standard where using a stat will level it up. Use enough stamina and it will increase your stamina bar. Taking enough damage will eventually increase your health. There is no cap to how much you can level up each stat, however the more you level up a stat the harder it will become to continue improving it. This system is applied globally in the game so that every action is affected including every ability you cast, your crafting skill and things like mining or chopping speed.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2086750\/extras\/Anti_Wiki.png?t=1658776973\" \/><br>While staying in a long term save is great, sometimes you also just want to start over and feel the struggle from the beginning again. With our anti-wiki feature each save file you start will be different. Rather than looking up the best sheep food or best monster drops, you will have to experiment in each save file to find the answer. A lot of these options are randomized so each new world will be different from the last.<br><br>As an example, in one world sheep may thrive on turnips and hate wheat. In another they eat turnips and wheat but love apples. Feeding your herds their favourite food will effect the resources they produce. They make more wool if they are fed their favourite food, but maybe will produce more meat if fed something they just tolerate. This idea will also go into play with crafting the best bow, sword, armour, etc. It will be up to you to experiment with the varied resource in the world to find their strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Our aim with this mechanic is to make the game play less clinical and encourage you to play and experiment more with your world. We love this idea but appreciate it might not be for everyone. We will closely listen to feedback and may include a setting to disable it if we feel its needed.","about_the_game":"Aiyana is a beautiful yet deadly alien world.
