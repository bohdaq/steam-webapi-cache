You work in a team with up to four of your friends and an angry garbage truck driver. Your job is to empty garbage cans and containers. Sadly your contract doesn't state what kind of work you are required to do, so your manager loads you with all kinds of extra work including firefighting and forest work. Naturally you are completely understaffed and your short tempered driver has no intention of stopping the truck and wait for you just because you couldn't empty all the garbage cans while extinguishing a raging wildfire. Luckily there are heaps of powerups that help you with all these tasks, so your stress level won't reach dangerous heights.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1681070\/extras\/s1.png?t=1635957466\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay<\/h2><br>Garbage Crew! is a roguelike action game so to progress to the next level you not only have to make a fight plan on how to coordinate your operation but also unlock and buy powerups that make your life much easier. To unlock the next level you need to complete all three incentives and finish the level in time. If you've made it in time and cleared at least one incentive you unlock a new powerup that will help you advance on your next run!
