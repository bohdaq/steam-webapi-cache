It’s got a lot of features that I love. It plays completely differently from a lot of other ones on the market [closer to Hearthstone or MtG].

And I think it’s a really, really good game. I think that if you are into card games, this is a very, very clean reproduction of Magic the Gathering with a little bit of tactical RPG and a little bit of roguelike randomness thrown in.
