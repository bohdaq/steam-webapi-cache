It consists of 3 parts, which provide a very good gaming experience at any time. At the beginning, the price is adjusted accordingly to the content and will be increased in the future. As the development of the main game progresses, the features will be integrated and included free of charge. The rule is that you only have to pay once, no matter what stage the add-on is in. With the purchase of this product, all parts are included. The breakdown is as follows:<br><br><strong>Phase 1: CargoTram<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vehicle: CargoTram Steuerwagen and Mittelwagen<br><\/li><li>Map: CargoTram main route (Güterverkehrszentrum - Mitte station (Maxstraße) - Altmarkt - VW Manufaktur<br><\/li><li>Map: Additional route via Schweriner Straße, Könneritzstraße, Dr.-Külz-Ring<\/li><\/ul>Route length approx. 8 km<br><br><strong>Phase 2: Half the Ring<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vehicle: Tatra T4D-MS tramcar<br><\/li><li>Map: Line 26 Part 1 (Fetscherplatz - Lennéplatz - Hauptbahnhof - Freiberger Straße - Bahnhof Neustadt)<\/li><\/ul>Line length approx. 8 km (total length approx. 16 km)<br><br>+ all contents of phase 1<br><br><strong>Phase 3: Core city<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vehicle: Tatra T4D-MT, TB4D-MT, B4D-MS<br><\/li><li>Map: Line 26 complete (Neustadt station - Albertbrücke - Johannstadt)<br><\/li><li>additionally: Albertplatz - Carolabrücke, Sachsenallee - Straßburger Platz, Große Meißner Straße\/Köpckestraße, Augustusbrücke - Postplatz<\/li><\/ul>.Route length approx. 10 km (total length approx. 26 km)<br>The price will be higher then.

This is not just any streetcar, at the beginning the CarGoTram is ready for you on its route starting at the freight center in Friedrichstadt to the Transparent Factory. In fact, it now takes a simulation to bring these journeys back to life. The CarGoTram ran on its route for probably the last time in December 2020. Furthermore, this add-on is intended to commemorate the Tatra streetcars from Prague. In 2000, the T4D still drove in large numbers through the Dresden capital. On the also already discontinued line 26 you can experience the upheaval in the post-reunification period. The trip takes you on a fake ring line from Johannstadt past the Transparent Factory, the Rudolf Harbig Stadium to the main station along the so-called 26-er Ring back to Johannstadt. As the name 26-er Ring suggests, this ring around the Alstadt of Dresden is known after the streetcar line. It is a pity that it no longer runs today.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get in and take a seat at the wheel for a little time travel to Dresden in the year 2000<\/h2>.<br>In this add-on, Dresden's city center awaits you with its colorful mixture of magnificent buildings and out-of-place GDR buildings, experienced from the perspective of the streetcar driver of a Dresden streetcar.
