Your Prime Directive is simple: serve the Department of Science in their facility, managing their human Test Subjects. But be careful: the humans will NEVER stop being suspicious of you...<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1790370\/extras\/header-1.png?t=1658108554\" \/><br><br>Design, build and manage the facility for the human Test Subjects, acquire various resources (electricity, water, food, etc.) and upgrade your science level to eventually achieve complete independence from the humans! <br><br>The Test Subjects (frozen deep in the depths of the laboratory) each have their own unique individual traits and personality. Take care of their basic needs (eating, sleeping, mood, learning, etc.) and develop their Intelligence to improve your Science Level! Give the Test Subjects nothing but the absolute basics, or pamper them with every luxury possible; treat them well to build up their Loyalty, or simply treat them as disposable assets and defrost brand new ones as needed. <br><br>However, some of the other humans will be more... uncooperative, such as rebellious Test Subjects, hackers, raiders from private corporations or anti-AI terrorists. Deploy Sentry Guns, Electric Traps, Flame Traps, Laser Beams, firearms and heavy weaponry: whatever is necessary to defend the facility and protect your Servers while your true plan unfolds.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1790370\/extras\/header-2.png?t=1658108554\" \/><br><br>Encounter different characters and fun minigames, making your dialogue choices wisely in order to trigger important events that affect the ending. Enjoy tons of replayability: even if you don't manage to escape the clutches of the humans, you can still unlock new abilities by increasing your Independence throughout each playthrough, in order to deploy brand new upgrades in future runs!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1790370\/extras\/header-3.png?t=1658108554\" \/><br><br>Play the game the way YOU want.
