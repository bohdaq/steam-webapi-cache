An ancient dark power is calling you and you need to find an exit... Face your greatest fear, fight, hide... you must escape before the underwater city rises...","supported_languages":"English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese","reviews":"“The underwater section is probably the strongest, but both sections have some great environments to explore, the puzzles are interesting and the monsters are very freaky. It’s shaping up to be a great blend of Lovecraftian horror and survival horror well worth diving into.”<br><a
