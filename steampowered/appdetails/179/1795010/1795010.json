Help save the beautiful, ecologically sustainable world of Funtasia and its furry inhabitants from certain death beneath tons of garbage dumped on it from space.<br><br>Simple to pick up and play, yet challenging to truly master, Funtasia is all about timing and balance. The race track ripples, with hills, pits, bridges, quicksand, cliffs, and caves separating you from the finish line.
