The ways of the fathers, forefathers, and Founding Fathers are together the beam upon which the Ship travels to our ultimate destination.

The Brotherhood's initially pure goal, to free the enslaved wherever they may be, has unfortunately been sullied by the practical concerns of democracy. To bring freedom to the Ship entire must involve war, and no war may be won without sacrifice, nor may battles be managed by committee.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/648410\/extras\/church.png?t=1655310569\" \/><br><br>As inevitably happens in dark and challenging times, some citizens turn to God for reassurance, the promise of an end to pain and hunger.

Teaching their adherents that they were chosen by God, the Church frames the journey of the Ship as a centuries-long test of faith.

Not a whole lot of noise to instantly alert the guards the moment you do something, but enough to add up over time and raise the guards' suspicions. The higher the guards' Perception, the faster the alert bar is filled. An alerted guard turns towards the last noise generated, meaning a lot of safe tiles will turn red and if you're in the line of vision you'll be instantly discovered. <br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/648410\/extras\/123.png?t=1655310569\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/648410\/extras\/Dialogue.png?t=1655310569\" \/><br><br>If fighting isn't you thing, you can avoid ALL combat by relying on speech skills: Persuasion, Streetwise, and Impersonate.

Teaching their adherents that they were chosen by God, the Church frames the journey of the Ship as a centuries-long test of faith.
