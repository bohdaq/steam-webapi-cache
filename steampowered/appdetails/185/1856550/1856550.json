This strange state in you escaped all conceptual schemas.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMagnus Imago is an atmospheric journey through a mysterious world of characters, traces and symbols.<br \/>\r\nUnique graphic aesthetics of the game deepens a keen impression of being in another reality.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n “Magnus Imago” is a combination of an adventure, exploratory and logical game. The task of the player is to solve the puzzles, using proper combinations of objects, finding them in the environment around him.<br \/>\r\nThe game has aesthetics of a hand drawing, individual comic-sketch style. The story is filled with a language of symbols which may direct the player into a deeper philosophical reflection. We strive for the told story to be open to the player’s individual interpretation, that is why the depicted world is ambiguous.<br \/>\r\nThe game presents a journey of the main character as he learns the truth about himself, in a mysterious world around him. The story told within the game has an ambition of touching such philosophical-theological aspects as a soul’s wandering or metanoia.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe estimated time of the game is about 1 to 2 hours<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is the next installment of the Magnus series (first one is Magnus Failure).
