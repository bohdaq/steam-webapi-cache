scientists working day and night created an enhanced version of our probably biggest invention of all time, a teleport that can send the brave human fighters right inside the enemy base.<br><br>But the crux is just coming right now, our heroes must search and acquire all the possible information about the enemy base to hopefully be able to destroy it ...<\/i><br><br><br>During the game, you must, destroy lurking enemies, or just avoid, take over them, find and use hidden aids, destroy, deactivate and avoid different kinds of gates, get through enemy waves, be patient, accurate, and quick when it's needed, test your memory in the labyrinths.<br>Do not forget to collect the missing pieces of the enemy base blueprint on each level to get to the next one and be able to unlock new spaceships!<br><br><u>SPOILER! <\/u><br>The game has a physics-based movement system so your space-ship moves with a bit of inertia, it could take a while to get familiar with it, figure out how to avoid or take over e.g. the enemy missiles, but do not give up, it is worth the effort I promise ;)<br>Precision and accuracy are also key to getting through the levels and you will need stamina too
