You develop as a manager, raise your reputation, earn experience, discover new abilities and move to increasingly famous clubs. But even if you like managing just one club, this expansion gives you new ways to manage — from motivating footballers to the ability to get the footballer of needed class from the youth academy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MANAGER’S CAREER<\/h2>We have added a whole layer of new mechanics to help you write your own story as a manager. Clubs from different countries will send you job offers and give you objectives depending on their ambitions and positions in tournaments, while you earn reputation for completing tasks and the club management reacts to your successes.  You will look at the game from a completely different angle and every new campaign will create a unique story just for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MANAGER LEVELING<\/h2>You will earn experience as a manager. When you get new levels, you will be able to choose manager abilities such as footballer motivation, individual training sessions, more influence on the youth academy and more. It will also be possible to upgrade abilities to make them more effective. To sum it up, you will have more opportunities to have a strategic influence over the development of the club.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WORLD SIMULATION<\/h2><strong>SIMULATION OF OTHER CONTINENTS<\/strong><br>Only your country and the Premier Leagues of countries on your continent were simulated before.
