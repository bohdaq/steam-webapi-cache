These are encapsulated into &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; type gameplay in most fighting games, for example blocking low or high. The key to making these games more enjoyable than simple rock-paper-scissors is by having uneven risk\/rewards for every option.

Our goal is to make the AI so realistic its impossible to tell if you're facing a real human or an AI.
