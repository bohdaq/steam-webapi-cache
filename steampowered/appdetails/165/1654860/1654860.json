It has a heartwarming story and theme to keep you pushing through to help the little guy make his way back to his family.  The difficulty was pleasant, I never got frustrated because it always felt manageable. It made me think of new ways to solve the puzzles. The setting to enable numbers on the tiles were a god send though. In the end it was a charming 2 hours for another perfected achievement game.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561198033066311\/recommended\/1654860\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Reviewer<\/a><br><br>“A very cute and relaxing puzzle game.
