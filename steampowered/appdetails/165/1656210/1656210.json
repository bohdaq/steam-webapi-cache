The first episode of a potential series by L. E.

Late at night, one of the town's citizens is murdered in cold blood! In a time when the local cops suspiciously underplay the incident, only one man - our lovable, bumbling everyguy Herbie - has the clinical insanity necessary to take the law into his own hands and fight the tides of corruption that threaten the town which TourAdvisor once called 'just the nicest place you could ever think of!'<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJoin Herbie and his crime fighting, alley hoppin' kitty Katt LeChatt as they... lounge around their house looking for Herbie's keys. Where the hell did he put them? I swear, you would lose your head if it wasn't attached! Well, crime fighting is certainly a priority, but first please join us in the slice of life comic book adventure game, 'The Adventures of Herbie &amp; Katt LeChatt'. This game is the first episode in a hypothetical series, and is designed to introduce you to the world, characters and sensibilities of Herbie &amp; Katt! Experience the cinematic comic book cutscenes and environments, and indulge yourself in conversations with a few old friends, all while jammin' out to some groovy tunes. And while you're at it, you may as well have a laugh.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nApprox. playing time - 1-3 hours.<br \/>\r\nReminder: This is only the introductory episode, and it is priced to reflect a culture that is willing to spend $5 on a cup of coffee or comic book.","about_the_game":"Cats, Crime &amp; Comedy, delivered in a stylish, old school point n' click fashion!
