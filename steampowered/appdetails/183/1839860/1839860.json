If you die close enough to an enemy, you will be able to possess its body and continue your bloody extravaganza. That means that the objective is not always to shoot your way through the level. Think carefully about who to kill. Sometimes, you know, it is better to die.<br><br><strong>Breakneck Shooting<\/strong>: Defeating enemies in Die Again will require all your skill as you shoot, dodge, and manipulate foes at lightning speed. Oh, you can Fortnite-dance too!<br><br><strong>Hand-Crafted Levels<\/strong>: Each stage is specially designed for several methods of completion. Shoot directly to your enemies, make bullets bounce off the wall or possess other’s bodies to overcome barriers. Think carefully and kill creatively.<br><br><strong>Bizarre Storytelling<\/strong>: Travel through a world changed by the Blue Blood to reach Ground Zero, the origin of everything. Fight for your life in a land ravaged by constant wars. Meet all kinds of unique characters whose evolution will be affected by your decisions.
