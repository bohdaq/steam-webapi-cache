Other names it is known by include: Dots and Boxes,  Boxes, Dot to Dot Grid, and Pigs In A Pen.  This version allows up to four human players plus one host computer (or five humans and no computer) to play the game.  The board size is adjustable up to limits imposed by the screen resolution.  The computer, even when not actively playing, can hint or play a dash for any player.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1834430\/extras\/8x10_Random_Board_1player_v_Machine.png?t=1645057886\" \/><br>Basic play is that the game starts with a grid of dots, and no dashes.  Players in turn place a dash between two horizontal or vertical dots.  If by doing so the player places the fourth side of one or two squares, they immediately earn another go of placing a dash. Such completed squares are marked with initials, symbol or colour.  The usual criteria for winning is the player with the most completed squares at the end of the game is the winner, however players are free to choose their own criteria for winning (e.g., a minimum number of squares).
