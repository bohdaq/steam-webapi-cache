Leads come from all kinds of movie genres and have unique ways of furthering their story arc which allows for different gameplay styles. Most also have unique special abilities in form of cards attached to them called “lead tropes”. <br><br>Pick a combination of three leads and build a 30-card deck to support them. Throughout the game you will gain Narrative Points that further your leads' story arcs. To win, you need to complete 2 of your lead character’s story arcs. Will you play as Richard Spade, the washed-up detective and rely on better information to out-predict your opponent with noir tropes? Or will you play as Illuminati Lizard and revel in the death of your characters? Will you play as Maximus and seek revenge on those who wronged you? Or play as Roast Comic Frog and mock your opponent with your unpredictable comedic timing? <br><br>The possibilities are endless... Well, numerous possibilities but mathematically limited! Seriously, you can’t literally have infinite possibilities. It's just a video game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single-Player<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1830700\/extras\/Posters.gif?t=1653053123\" \/><br>After learning how to play in the tutorial you will get a deck to start building your collection.
