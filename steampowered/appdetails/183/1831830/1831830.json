But it will not be that easy! The dragon attacks the board every time the pawn moves and every undefended piece will die. So you need the help of your friends (Rooks, Bishops and Knights) to protect your pawn all along the way to the dragon's core. This is a strategic game for chess enthusiasts of all levels. Sacrifices will be necessary along the way, so be ready!<br><br><strong>What if... chess pieces were samurais fighting a legendary Ronin in feudal Japan?<\/strong><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1831830\/extras\/ronin-gif__1_.gif?t=1659066028\" \/><br><br>In Lady Ronin, chess meets sokoban as you have never seen before. You play with a legendary Ronin (a chess queen) and you need to eliminate the other pieces in order to get close to the Shogun and kill it. Pieces move like in chess, but push each other like in sokoban. Can you pass through legions of samurais to achieve your goal?<br><br><strong>What if... the chess board was a soccer field and chess pieces strive not for checkmate, but for goals?<\/strong><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1831830\/extras\/soccer-gif__8_.gif?t=1659066028\" \/><br><br>In Soccer Chess you will play a soccer match using chess pieces and tactics!
