For the ship you’re on is cursed, and with it, its crew. <br><br>You cannot prevent what lays ahead of you, all you can do is take control over what is happening. The only way to survive is to be a captain, the captain of the cursed crew. <br><br>Cursed crew is a rogue-like naval ship simulator, where you run a 18th century sailing ship in a fantasy setting. You control a captain, and it’s your responsibility that the crew survives all the perils of the dark seas you’re sailing. You need to make sure there are enough resources like timber, food and cannonballs on the ship, and when hell breaks loose, you have to guide your (not always competent) crew through it. As the game progresses, your crew gets more and more cursed, adding unique twists to your playthrough.

In order to survive, you need to make sure your crew is well fed, loyal, and sane.<br><br>Between locations and events, you will be sailing across the seas. It’s not as easy as it sounds, though, as this is where the worst can happen - mutiny, starvation, dying from cold or heat or simply going insane.
