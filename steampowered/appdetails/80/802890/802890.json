In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research, and the UN opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V.  A tiny fraction of the population would abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system.
