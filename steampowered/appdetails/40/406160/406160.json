Hyperspace opened the door to the stars, but habitable worlds are few and far in between, overpopulation is still rampant, and our civilization's appetite for resources has only increased.

But humanity’s fighting chance only lasted for a short hundred years.<br><br>Now, it has gone dark. Freighters stopped arriving with supply hauls and humanity is facing an unprecedented crisis. It's up to the commander of UEN's finest fleet, to deploy into the Dust Zone, investigate, and solve the supply chain crisis before it spirals out of control.
