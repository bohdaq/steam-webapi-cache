Half-way through all modes, there is a half-time, dice rolling mini-game called Midnight. Keeping at least one die per round, you will try to score a 1 and 4 then all other dice are your points. You'll net a fancy trophy and bonus points for your final score by winning.<br><br><strong>In normal mode,<\/strong> you will compete to get the highest drunk score you can without going overboard. Of course you can always tank your opponent's liver to double the amount of drunk points they accumulate per drink, pushing them over the limit. Or you can reduce their health to zero and end the match fast. Use your accumulated drinks list, various status effects, or brutal mixology to win.

Generic sludge drinks won't have any affect but will, however, count towards your end score. Learn new drinks on the fly or buy the Bartender's Book from the Shady Merchant to get the upper-hand. Utilize status effects to your advantage and slang one of 209 drinks to win.  Beyond that, same rules apply as in normal mode: higher drunk score the better, reduce health to zero, or score decides the winner.<br><br><strong>In The Sobering,<\/strong> you are trying to keep your wits about you and your drunk score to a minimum. Ideally zero, or at least lower than your opponent. Keep an eye on your liver though, if it hits zero then you start taking double the drunk points per drink.
