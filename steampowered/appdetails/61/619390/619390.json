Soulstorm features casual and often comedic violence towards alien characters that are humanoid in nature.\r\nThese characters can be shot, burned, blown up, crushed, electrocuted, eaten by wildlife and generally mangled by various enemies, the environment or the player themselves.\r\nThe narrative features themes of addiction and substance abuse, subjugation of species and fomenting of revolutionary aspirations."}}}}
