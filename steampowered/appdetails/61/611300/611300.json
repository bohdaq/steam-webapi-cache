It focuses on close quarters infantry combat and aims to provide competitive arcade-style gameplay inspired by classic third-person shooters. Unfortunately it has amateur animations, store-bought character skins, and there's tons of things missing and unfinished because we ran out of both time and money. But our plan is to develop maps inspired by locations around the world where special operations are conducted. These could be jungles, deserts, urban areas or snowy environments. This requires a lot of realistic high quality content that covers a wide array of regions. Therefore we need a competent team of artists that can create these characters and environments. So if you don't buy this game we won't have the funding required to pay these people. Then we'll never be able to achieve our dream of developing this game, and just think how shitty you would feel about yourself if you did that to us.<br><br><strong>TACTICAL THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY<\/strong><br>Gameplay focuses on close quarters infantry combat where communication and teamwork are required. Expanding crosshairs provide a sense of weapon inaccuracy which is affected by recoil, stance, movement, and a few other factors. It rewards bursting by keeping tighter shots more precise while still allowing for accurate spray.<br><br><strong>STRATEGIC ROUND-BASED GAME MODES<\/strong><br>Game modes are round-based and mostly focus on single-life objectives. They’ll involve aspects such as planting or defusing bombs, extracting or guarding hostages, and capturing or defending intel. Each map will be designed to a specific game mode but may also have different areas sectioned off for different modes.<br><br>However instead of telling you what kind of shooter Task Force will be, why don't we tell you what kind of shooter it won't be.
