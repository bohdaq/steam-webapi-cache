We realise not everyone who purchases alpha games wants to help test and progress game development, but we would appreciate anyone playing the alpha version to report any bugs or contact our team on the many platforms available, including Steam, Discord or social media.<br><br><strong>WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME<\/strong><br>Jaws of Extinction is currently in its alpha stages. This means that it is still heavily in development. The game is not presently on sale, because we feel that JoE is NOT (quite yet) ready to go live to the public.<br><br>As is normally the case with games in development, the developers are continually working on the many issues, including bugs with mechanics, missing content and performance related issues currently affecting the game.<br><br><i>If you wish to ask the community for advice on whether the game is playable on your current system set up, we suggest joining our Steam or Discord community, links provided below.<\/i><br><br><strong>Discord:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/playjoegame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/playjoegame<\/a><br><br><strong>WHEN WILL MULTIPLAYER BE AVAILABLE<\/strong><br>We are currently fine tuning current mechanics, building out content and working on performance improvements. Once we are happy that you will be happy with single player we will start to stagger protagonist character releases. Then coop will be introduced where you can play as different protagonists together. <br><br>Coop will start with two-player, then will be expanded fully to three and four-player coop. Eventually, the game will be ready for testing on dedicated servers provided by our partner GTX Gaming (<a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gtxgaming.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http:\/\/www.gtxgaming.co.uk<\/a>). You will also be able to rent servers from them, integrated with other partner Tebex (<a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.tebex.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/www.tebex.io\/<\/a>) using the tebex system to help monetize your server and community if you wish.<br><br><br><strong>WHEN WILL THE MAIN STORY BE AVAILABLE<\/strong><br>As each protagonist character is released we will also be releasing an introductory single player story level (optional to play) teaching you the basics of the game and the character’s abilities. <br><br>The main story will be released in chapters in free updates (non-DLC).<br><br><strong>For more information, join our discord:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/playjoegame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/playjoegame<\/a><\/p><br><h1>BEFORE YOU PURCHASE: An important message from the dev team<\/h1><p><i>In the spirit of our ethos of transparency and integrity we want you to know that our game is at ALPHA stage in EARLY ACCESS and will therefore contain many bugs and have performance issues on low to mid-end machines. We’re really proud of how it plays so far (it’s a lot of fun!) but if your rig DOES NOT meet the RECOMMENDED spec then the game may not perform well and as much as we appreciate your support we would suggest that you wait until later in development before you invest your money. We don’t want you buying something that’s going to disappoint you.<\/i><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/617850\/extras\/About.png?t=1657280890\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO SURVIVE ONE MORE DAY?<\/h2>Jaws Of Extinction (JoE) is a story-driven, single-player, and multiplayer, horror-survival RPG.
