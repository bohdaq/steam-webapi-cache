STRANGER is overall a great game so far, and I feel it will get even better as the lifecycle goes on and more maps, mechanics, animations, etc. are added. My favorite part is the sheer ambience in the game. From the lightning and thunder outside, to the rustling of leaves, buzzing of bugs outside. The game has a high level of replayability, as the Stranger's AI is pretty difficult to predict at times, and he is a sneaky fella. I can undoubtedly say that the talented developer, Will has poured his heart and soul into the game, and will do exactly that in future updates as well as his future games. I met Will when he was about halfway done with the game, and I was immediately envious of his energy, ambition, drive and talent. Following along with the development of Stranger has inspired me to want to make my own game someday. 9\/10 at its current stage”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/OpTiCaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nitro on Discord<\/a><br><br>“This game looks promising, the first thing I noticed was that it had multiple levels which is exciting, not what I expected.
