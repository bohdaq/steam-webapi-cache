It’s my life’s work in a collection, some of the most ambitious orchestral pieces I felt I’ve composed to date, and my ultimate swan song to the JRPG genre in gaming.<br><br>It’s with the finest pleasure that I now share this work for others to be able to relive this experience of being a part of this video game - this work of art that I am so humbly privileged to be given the chance as a composer to make my muse for the past 10 years, all thanks to one sole developer who was willing to take a chance on me on one of my first ever scoring projects.
