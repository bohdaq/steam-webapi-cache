The name is Posey and I am the leader of this rag tag bunch of indie game devs. We are currently developing this project in full transparency with the public through something we are calling Iterative Fishbowl Development, (go read the Early Access for more info). I know that sounds like some strange aquarium device but it isn't; it means that you, the consumer can anytime peak in and see what we are working on and be truly apart of the creation process...well as much apart of the creation process as you are at Krispy Kreme watching your hot-n-now dozen of doughnuts get made. Anywho enjoy the following words as much as I did writing them!<br><br>Seneca 7: A Cyberpunk Odyssey is an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game) centered around establishing a successful settlement on an alien planet through combat, exploration, farming, and resource management. Set in a newly discovered solar system lightyears from Earth, in this brave new world the settlers utilize Cryptocurrency, collect and trade NFTs, and rely on the Blockchain to handle their daily societal functions. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br><strong>Neat Point One<\/strong><br>The story will follow an exciting narrative that offers multiple branches of story, different game modes with tons of replayability, and a class system where you can develop characters to use in action-based combat while exploring the vast new world outside of the settlement, or maintain order within it to ensure its success! When it comes to this genre of game and the Crypto-space, generally you either already know it and participate in the space, or you don’t want anything to do with it. We’re here to disrupt that mindset and build a bridge between the Crypto-enthusiasts and gamers by making, selling, and playing an awesome game!<br><br><strong>Neat Point Two<\/strong><br>Mixing the intricacies of farming and resource management with combat and exploration! You can even have a pet and companions join you on your treks outside of the settlement! There will be plenty of vibrant vistas inspired by album covers, crazy alien creatures ready to tear you apart, and all within a cyberpunk sci-fi setting focused on how this world could differ from any version of Earth you’ve ever seen. A dystopia fueled by corporate greed with no rules save for one: MONEY = POWER or a true second chance for humanity.<br><br><strong>Neat Point Three<\/strong><br>Explore various options and worldviews in a divergent storyline. Multiple narrative threads and possible branches in your path gives you the freedom to tell your own story. How will you react to what you learn, and what will you do with the information you gather? Will you pursue a quiet life, or seek to change things for the better? Choose between peaceful days as a farmer and gatherer, or leave the settlement to go on crazy adventures! Hunt and fight using our combat system! No matter your play style, there’s a second life for you here.<br><br><strong>Neat Point Four<\/strong><br>Through this setting and its story, you’ll be able to learn about how cryptocurrency works, what the blockchain is, and why NFTs are so misused. Learn about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the industry through family friendly humor, and meet over 70 other settlers to form deep relationships and connections with them! Learn why they’re here, what they think of things, and how they’re handling their new lives in this alien settlement called Seneca 7.<br><br>Hurrah! You made it to the end...or the end for now!

The name is Posey and I am the leader of this rag tag bunch of indie game devs. We are currently developing this project in full transparency with the public through something we are calling Iterative Fishbowl Development, (go read the Early Access for more info). I know that sounds like some strange aquarium device but it isn't; it means that you, the consumer can anytime peak in and see what we are working on and be truly apart of the creation process...well as much apart of the creation process as you are at Krispy Kreme watching your hot-n-now dozen of doughnuts get made. Anywho enjoy the following words as much as I did writing them!<br><br>Seneca 7: A Cyberpunk Odyssey is an ARPG (Action Role Playing Game) centered around establishing a successful settlement on an alien planet through combat, exploration, farming, and resource management. Set in a newly discovered solar system lightyears from Earth, in this brave new world the settlers utilize Cryptocurrency, collect and trade NFTs, and rely on the Blockchain to handle their daily societal functions. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br><strong>Neat Point One<\/strong><br>The story will follow an exciting narrative that offers multiple branches of story, different game modes with tons of replayability, and a class system where you can develop characters to use in action-based combat while exploring the vast new world outside of the settlement, or maintain order within it to ensure its success! When it comes to this genre of game and the Crypto-space, generally you either already know it and participate in the space, or you don’t want anything to do with it. We’re here to disrupt that mindset and build a bridge between the Crypto-enthusiasts and gamers by making, selling, and playing an awesome game!<br><br><strong>Neat Point Two<\/strong><br>Mixing the intricacies of farming and resource management with combat and exploration! You can even have a pet and companions join you on your treks outside of the settlement! There will be plenty of vibrant vistas inspired by album covers, crazy alien creatures ready to tear you apart, and all within a cyberpunk sci-fi setting focused on how this world could differ from any version of Earth you’ve ever seen. A dystopia fueled by corporate greed with no rules save for one: MONEY = POWER or a true second chance for humanity.<br><br><strong>Neat Point Three<\/strong><br>Explore various options and worldviews in a divergent storyline. Multiple narrative threads and possible branches in your path gives you the freedom to tell your own story. How will you react to what you learn, and what will you do with the information you gather? Will you pursue a quiet life, or seek to change things for the better? Choose between peaceful days as a farmer and gatherer, or leave the settlement to go on crazy adventures! Hunt and fight using our combat system! No matter your play style, there’s a second life for you here.<br><br><strong>Neat Point Four<\/strong><br>Through this setting and its story, you’ll be able to learn about how cryptocurrency works, what the blockchain is, and why NFTs are so misused. Learn about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the industry through family friendly humor, and meet over 70 other settlers to form deep relationships and connections with them! Learn why they’re here, what they think of things, and how they’re handling their new lives in this alien settlement called Seneca 7.<br><br>Hurrah! You made it to the end...or the end for now! Till the next episode!","short_description":"Seneca 7 is an action-packed cyberpunk reimagining of the classic farm sim games.
