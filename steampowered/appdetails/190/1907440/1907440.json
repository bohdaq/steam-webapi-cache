{"1907440":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Super Lone Survivor","steam_appid":1907440,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The godfather of indie survival horror returns with a complete reimagining of his 2012 classic, often cited by critics as one of the greatest horror games of all time. Jasper Byrne's LONE SURVIVOR in many ways spearheaded the modern, lofi indie horror movement.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs the masked protagonist, you must escape the city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary. Use stealth to scavenge food, or kill everything in your path. Nurture your mental health or descend into madness. How you survive is up to you. Multiple endings reflect all the actions you take, great or small, to a degree of detail found in few other games.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLONE SURVIVOR has only become more relevant with the global pandemic. Its themes of self-care during isolation imposed by disease, and the iconic mask of our hero really do seem to sum up where the world is at right now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSUPER has been rebuilt from the ground up with a new engine. It represents over two years' work. There's improved lighting and shaders, 4K support and beyond, extensive controller support, all-new ultra smooth parallax scrolling layers. Additionally the game contains a new 4:3 presentation mode and the original art has been painstakingly extended in height to support this taller aspect ratio. The game will look unbelievable on a CRT! <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn top of this there is quite a bit of new content exclusive to the game, hidden areas that will require cunning to discover, and an overarching sidequest that ties it all together. New foods to discover and craft, new enemy types and even new combat tools.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally, the game aims to both be more accessible via its 'Relaxed' difficulty setting, and more challenging through its 'Stressful' one, opening it up to a new audience, and giving hardcore fans more to explore.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLONE SURVIVOR was also well known for its soundtrack, with Jasper being primarily a musician who happens to make games, and the new version includes remastered audio in much higher quality, as well close to an album's worth of new material.","about_the_game":"The godfather of indie survival horror returns with a complete reimagining of his 2012 classic, often cited by critics as one of the greatest horror games of all time.
