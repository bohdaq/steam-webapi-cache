Perhaps the harsh cut of the wind or a storm in the forest does not alarm you. If that is so, I am certain our woods, streams and caverns will attract your interest, offering many a delightful diversion. Even the otherwise abysmal village of Barovia boasts a charming cemetery. You must visit it. Perhaps, if your party survives... that is, stays long enough in this harsh and unyielding home of mine, I may require its presence. I shall ask you to join me in Ravenloft, my castle upon the precipice overlooking Barovia. It is not an invitation to be refused. <br><br>I give my leave for your party to enjoy our misty, twilight dangers. Let you challenge your wits and fighting skills; may the perilous magics of my land enchant them. But heed this warning and do not play at cross-purposes with me.
