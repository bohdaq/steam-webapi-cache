Fight Chaos Spawn in order to keep you alive while making your Master stronger in the process. Dedicate your in-game life to hunt these demons and climb the ladder of Chaos Hunters. Or, you can just live a simple life in the main Town. In Born Anew you will have a lot of ways to make money, by opening a small shop, fishing, hunting, gardening or Hunt beasts and chaos spawn for rewards at the Hunter Guild. <br \/>\r\nBut do remember, not only do you need food, sleep and water, you also need to occasionally kill Chaos beings in order to keep your Master happy and in return, he will keep you alive. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game will have 0 main Story quests, as it is also a Life Simulator. There is no &quot;End&quot; of the game other than you not playing anymore. The game will have stories and many long and interesting quests to do, but not a main story line. As the point of the game is to play as you see fit and enjoy the ride in a Casual setting while also being immersed in the game. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis game is made by one person from one end to the other, this is also the first game I made and I have been working on it for a while now. I am hoping to finish it before January 2023 but I am unsure if that is feasible taking in consideration I also have to keep a full time job. I am working on the game in my spare time only because I have zero funding.","about_the_game":"Born Anew is a 2D Platformer RPG game set in an Open World.
