These rooms will unlock throughout each phase and will have a new unique enemy you must encounter. In Paresis these enemies are called Morphs and they have their own positives and negatives. For example, one may be faster then another but they will have fewer hiding spots. On the other hand, you, the player, have<strong><i> zero movement<\/i><\/strong> and must use your <strong><i>lean<\/i><\/strong> and <strong><i>flame energy<\/i><\/strong> to survive the phase. Each phase within Paresis takes 5 minutes. However, each phase will become harder and you must undergo new obstacles.
