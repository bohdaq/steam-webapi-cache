One of the main features of Flightpath is giving the players the ability to make choices. In select stages, you will be presented with an option to take one of two possible paths.

So, while Flightpath is a top-down shoot’em up, it is not a bullet-hell shooter. Instead of predetermined, synchronized attacks, we created a chaotic, unpredictable mayhem of action. Enemies spawn and attack patterns are procedurally generated, to keep you on your toes on each run. <br><br>Of course, this is not limited to just the enemies. The stages themselves are built procedurally, to keep things interesting on your second, third, or fourth run!<br><br>You are not just shooting, though! Depending on the stage, you’ll be asked to perform some sort of task to clear it. You might have to rescue an NPC, destroy an enemy installation, pick up some quest items, or, of course, fight evil bosses!<br><br>Each story run takes place throughout 10 different locations, each with its own unique setting.","about_the_game":"Welcome to Venaris, a small planetary system where an underground criminal organization, known only as “The Syndicate”, continuously terrorizes its citizens while corrupt security forces have little will or power to bring this organization down.<br><br>This is where three unrelated individuals decided to take matters into their own hands: Katherine “Kath” McKenzie, a mechanical engineer who spends most of her time tinkering with spaceships; A.J., a disgraced ex-detective who was framed for a crime The Syndicate committed; and Maxine “Max” Speed, a professional speedster racer.<br><br>After each of them crossed paths with the criminal organization, they vowed to find their leader, a shady figure that goes by “The Chairman”, and bring him to justice, whatever it takes.<br><br>Here, you follow the events of the three main characters in their quest to defeat The Syndicate.
