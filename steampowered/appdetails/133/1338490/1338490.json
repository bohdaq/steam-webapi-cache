Various physical and mental ailments, fear, unavailability of resources, and no sense of security impacted the tribes in a catastrophic way. Mutual trust eroded, and was replaced by hostility and aggression. Constantly erupting conflicts and disputes quickly turned into open war.

Many terrifying legends have been told about this place and no one dared enter them for fear of discovering the truth behind these stories. It was said to be the birthplace of magic; the good kind - the magic which awakened the life of the beautiful planet, and the evil kind - the magic which spawned powerful underground creatures protecting these mysterious caves and underground passages at all costs.
