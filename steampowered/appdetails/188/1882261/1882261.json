Although nothing has been confirmed, renowned but troublesome archaeologist, Wently Kelso believes the disturbances are related to an evil uprising and the presence of a powerful ancient artefact. These troubles could, of course, simply be the work of unruly bandits, but since Kelso’s previous findings in the sewers of Waterdeep proved true, one would be wise not to easily dismiss his opinion on the matter.
