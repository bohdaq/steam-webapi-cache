After that, you'll find yourself in a house filled with traps to avoid and healing medicine kits to collect! After that, you'll return to the forest in order to continue your journey and take back your freedom! Then there's a basement where there are zombies in every room, and you have to search for and collect keys to get out! Finally, you find yourself in a forest full of zombies who are much faster than you and against whom you have no defense! Nothing is as simple as it appears.
