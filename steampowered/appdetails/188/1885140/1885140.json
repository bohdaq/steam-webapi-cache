With a game controller, Guntech 2 is a twin-stick shooter where you use the left stick to steer and thrust your ship, and the right stick to control the railgun. Your ship has a total of three different weapons. <br><br>The shoulder buttons fire the two additional, more powerful weapons which always fire in the direction of your ship's nose. This gives you the ability to shoot any direction using the railgun, with extra firepower when you position your ship towards the enemy.<br><br>Using a keyboard you use WASD or the arrow keys to steer and thrust, SHIFT \/ SPACE for the other weapons and a mouse for the railgun.
