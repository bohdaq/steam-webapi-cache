The only thing they agree on is this: your little group isn't going down easily.<br \/>\r\n• Gather a group of survivors and lead them to safety. These are common folk, and they can't fight — but they can help you survive as long as you do the same for them.<br \/>\r\n• Survive the calamity with the odds stacked against you. Learn to treasure every piece of equipment you can get, and use every quirk of the battlefield to your advantage.<br \/>\r\n• Learn the secrets of a long-forgotten demon lord, confront his terrifying followers, and glimpse his otherworldly domain.<br \/>\r\n• Import your victories into the main story.
