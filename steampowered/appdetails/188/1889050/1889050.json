Inspired by tabletop role playing games (aka TTRPG)  like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and many others; the core of our tool is you and your friends telling a story together. You start by choosing between playing as a Game Master (aka GM) or one of up to four Adventurers. Game Masters create the stories and worlds that Adventurers traverse. Guiding them through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, and much more. As an Adventurer you roleplay as your character through those scenarios, adding your characters personality and ambitions to the story. The gameplay is what's known as a player driven story. Meaning every playthrough will be different. What you say, what you do, and how you work with your team influence the outcome and flow of the story. Legends And Lore is a dynamic system that gives unique tools to both Game Masters and Adventurers, in order to bring your ttrpgs to life!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1889050\/extras\/SpellFireBall.gif?t=1659064324\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adventurer<\/h2>Players who choose the Adventurer role design their characters.
