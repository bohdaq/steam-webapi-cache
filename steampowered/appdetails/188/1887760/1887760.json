{"1887760":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Epicenter VR","steam_appid":1887760,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"In a post-apocalyptic island city, it's your mission to ensure the safety and rescue of the last few survivors. Just days before, there was a severe virus outbreak, resulting in most of the citizens becoming mindless zombies bent on devouring human flesh. Fortunately, these zombies are averse to bright lights! Utilize your flashlight to deter zombies and flock to street lamps and other bright light sources to stay safe from the hoard! Use your various weapons and tools to collect the necessary supplies, contact the National Guard, and escape from the island! But be cautious, as zombies are very curious and will investigate noises such as loud footsteps, gunshots, and thrown rocks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So what exactly is this game?<\/h2> Epicenter VR is based on a project spawned out of a flat-screen game of the same name. The original was fairly small in scope and was built in a month for a college course. After about a year I decided to not only expand on the project but to also port everything over to VR. I believe in the future of VR and want to see more &quot;pretty good&quot; VR games on Steam. At first, my intention was to port Epicenter to VR, keeping most things the same, and just releasing it for free. This is already done. However as I reached the end of that development cycle, it became clear to me that I should further expand on the title, implement some replayability features, and sell it on Steam. <br><br><br><strong>And here we are!<\/strong> While I still have a long way to go, I'm now ready to publicly show the game off and start updating everyone with the current progress I'm making! I will present a list of big-ticket features I'm still working on below. Also, I currently don't have plans to drop the game as an Early-Access title, but if that changes, I'm committed to having the bulk of the biggest features done before giving Early-Access. We've all seen the tons of games in Early-Access purgatory that haven't updated in months or years, and I plan to avoid that. Development is currently about 4-10 hours a week depending on other plans, and I plan to offer consistent updates on both in-progress and completed work.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current Progress<\/h2>Here is the current list of major features, completed, in progress, and future work.
