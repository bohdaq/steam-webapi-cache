To succeed as a leader you will need to defend your part of the field against other eternal warriors. It will hopefully be a long time until Ragnarok is upon us, so you will have time to find new strategies, learn of new technologies and improve your fighting capabilities.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game is structured into 2 parts, a turn-based building phase and an RTS combat phase. Your leader will keep his knowledge and experience between plays, but your people will still need to learn how to do everything, every game. Every combat phase you will need to defend against random waves of enemies, and will have opportunities for extra advantages and knowledge that needs to be fought for, while keeping your resources and keep defended. In the build phase you use the resource you have gathered to prepare for later.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis game was made by a single person, who is not equally talented in every facet of game development, and some parts are therefore more finely made than others.
