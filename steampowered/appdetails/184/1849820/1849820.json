Each and every map provides new tactical considerations, and there is a pretty wide variety of goals....This is only enhanced with all the ways that characters are able to interact with these maps. Certain characters are able to transform the battlefield in specific ways (the ice mage can turn water into traversable ice) and there is even a character whose entire toolset is focused on transforming the battlefield in fun and interesting ways.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/explorminate.co\/telepath-tactics-liberated-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >eXplorminate<\/a><br><br>“The verdict?
