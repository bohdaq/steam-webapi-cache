Take on the role of Dean or Ellie, pick up your weapon and save your planet and possibly the galaxy!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nKey Features:<br \/>\r\n-Explore an ancient labyrinth consisting of 7 interconnected zones<br \/>\r\n-Blast cyborg dinosaurs and other dangerous creatures with 6 different weapons (Primal Elements)<br \/>\r\n-Discover up to 9 upgrades to help defeat your enemies and reach new areas<br \/>\r\n-Fight alone or take a friend and play 2-player co-op<br \/>\r\n-Battle 13 challenging bosses<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDeveloper:<br \/>\r\nHello, my name is Jordan and I'm creating Primal Threat in my spare time.  I work at a grocery store, and I’m one of the managers, so I try to dedicate an hour or two each evening on my dream game.  When my son Dean was born in July of 2020, my wife and I decided to decorate his room with a dinosaur theme and my imagination went wild with ideas for my next game.  Dean and my niece Ellie are the two main characters in this adventure.  I am developing the Primal Threat on my own, but my cousin Kristian created all the music.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy first game was Muzzleloaded.  I believe it was a great learning project, but there were certain features that I couldn't create, which I was eventually able to implement in Primal Threat such as: A revealing map, multiple weapons to equip, local co-op, and multiple upgrades such as transforming into a tiny dinosaur!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPrimal Threat is a short, but true Metroidvania where upgrades are necessary for overcoming bosses, enemies, and obstacles.  The enemy designs are inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog enemies.  The level design is highly inspired by Metroid and the shooting\/weapon change mechanic by Axiom Verge.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe co-op mode is a throwback to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 where Tails gets to join Sonic on their epic adventure.  It does make the game easier having a friend to help, but through playtesting it so far, it is a blast! <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPrimal Threat's hook is doing tremendous damage to enemies by shooting them with a weapon of complimentary color.  There are 6 weapons for players to find throughout the world, each having a different color based on which zone it is found.  Players who can correctly change weapons on the fly will be able to eliminate enemies quickly.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI am currently working on the “speed run” feature, which I hope will get people to race through the world of Primal Threat with incredible speed.  Thank you so much for your interest in my game!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSincerely,<br \/>\r\nJordan Keith","about_the_game":"Story:<br \/>\r\nAn ancient alien race is trying to destroy worlds and take their powers; Earth is next!
