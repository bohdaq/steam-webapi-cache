protagonist of Life is Strange Remastered, Max Caulfield, can rewind time at will.

This Game deals honestly with complex emotions, difficult themes, and rare but shocking acts of violence. As such, it may contain content not appropriate for all ages, and may not be appropriate for viewing at work, with cautions suggested for Intense Violence, Blood, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, and Use of Drugs and Alcohol."}}}}
