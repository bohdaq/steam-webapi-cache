Choose from an assortment of tech filled submarines, investigate anomalies and gather evidence to discover what caused the problem. But beware, dangers lurk above and below the water. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOceans exhibit some of the most fragile ecosystems, even the smallest of anomalies can tip the scales and turn a bustling home for sea-life into barren waters.<br \/>\r\nAnomalies can vary from ecological, exploitation or even natural disasters. It’s up to your team to work together to discover the cause, log the evidence required, and choose whether it’s time to fight or flight. Your team could turn in your evidence for money, or face the problem head on for an even larger reward. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnderwater maps are procedurally generated, so gathering evidence will be a different experience with each game. Maps may include; coral reefs, kelp forests, deep trenches, caves and volcanos. Also depending on the ecosystem, these areas could potentially help or hinder the players as they explore.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEach player will have an array of items at their helm, each with different uses. Some items are used to discover evidence like finding abnormalities in water samples, or hacking into radio frequencies to listen in on secret conversations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOther items are used solely to protect your team, as there are threats lurking above and below the water. This includes items to hide your team's radar presence, distract large creatures, or even stop boats in their tracks.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd lastly, there are items purely for Marine Biology. This includes scanning and logging ecosystems so players can learn about different creatures, coral and crustaceans. Or use the power of marine biology to turn the tides in a tricky situation. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEmpowered through the acquisition of information, your team must work together to evade, sabotage and manipulate anything that is stopping you from your tasks. Through different submarine types chosen at the beginning of each session, players will fulfil roles that are both unique and important to the team’s goals.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThroughout games you'll learn more about Max, a blind young adult who lost his estranged mother. In possibly the strangest inheritance in history, all she left him was this old submarine. Retrace her steps as an ecological vigilante and team up with fellow crusaders, Roger and Bazza to uncover a deep mystery.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game supports its' stealth based gameplay through sound: as you pilot through shark infested waters, or slink over the ocean floor to remain undetected, the submarine's audio-based sonar system assists your journey. Listen closely and learn of dangers that you might not see on screen.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nImmerse yourself in unique underwater environments. Drift through colourful coral reefs, stealth in the dark and unsettling deep, carefully pilot through underwater caves, and track unbeknownst foes from below in serene, beautiful, and dangerous locations.","about_the_game":"4 Player Cooperative Stealth and Investigation Roguelite game about Conservation and Subterfuge (with submarines!)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour team are tasked with mapping the sea floor, and to fix any anomalies along the way.
