this compilation contains basically nearly every single game we've made since 2008, that means it's a whole hodge podge of whatever; you got cursing clowns on a trampoline, mechs shooting at fictional terrorists, a sentient boat killing wooden sharks, shirtless gladiators engaging in weaponized combat, blood coming out of things that should not bleed, explosions coming of things that should not explode, references to the consumption of meat substances, I think someone dropped an F bomb somewhere in there too.\r\n\r\nAlso, to top it all off, most of these games came from over a decade ago, the 2000s were a different time, man. So yeah, we are well aware that some subject matter may or may not be kosher in this current social context; tbh it probably wasn't back then either."}}}}
