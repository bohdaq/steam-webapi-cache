it is that it undeniably has a narrative, even though it features no words… but what’s more incredible to me is how different that narrative can be for different people… This game not only tries to put us in the emotional state of that crushing loneliness… but it lets us explore it, and this to me is the unique power games have.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4QwcI4iQt2Y\"
