The aim of the mod is to create an environment that respects the nature of the original Company of Heroes gameplay, while expanding core features to put further focus on tactics, proper decision making, and player skill. Back to Basics can be played PvP, but also features AI opponents capable of challenging battle-hardened players.<br><br>Company of Heroes: Back to Basics has active development. We continue to develop the mod to consistently improve the core gameplay, game balance and overall player experience.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Join our Discord: <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/NmAaSkW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https:\/\/discord.gg\/NmAaSkW<\/a> !

Each unit was carefully selected and designed, offering diversity while retaining clear unit roles and purposes to avoid unnecessary unit overlap. Many of the original core unit designs and envisioned roles were kept intact to retain a sense of familiarity, yet were expanded upon to enhance the overall depth and complementary dynamic between units.<br><br>Command Trees have been expanded to permit various progression paths that synergise with various faction strategies. The nodes for each branch were shuffled around to offer more interesting choices throughout, while also mitigating the evident power differences between branches. Practically every feature in each of the Command Trees received some attention; from minor balance adjustments and bug fixes, to fully revised functionality of certain abilities, units, and upgrades, and plenty of new content has been added with the aim to broaden the versatility of each tree.<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New gameplay mechanics &amp; enhanced combat<\/h2>Along with new units, abilities, upgrades, and command trees, the mod features <strong>an entirely new weapon damage model<\/strong> as well as <strong>brand new gameplay mechanics<\/strong>. The damage model is generally more lethal with a lower time-to-kill than the base game. At the same time it is as fair, balanced, and consistent as possible with almost all instances of instant squad wipes removed from the game. New gameplay mechanics featured in Back to Basics include <strong>“Enfilading fire”<\/strong>; squads receiving fire from multiple directions are prone to taking more damage, <strong>“Anti-blob”<\/strong>; clumped up infantry squads receive penalties to their overall combat effectiveness, and <strong>“Regeneration”<\/strong>; infantry squads out of combat will slowly regenerate hitpoints over time.<br><br>Those who take the time to understand and adapt to the enhanced damage model and mechanics will find that the battles are dynamic, with a wide spectrum of playstyles being viable. The impact of utilising different types of weaponry is strong and worthwhile, as each weapon has a unique role and performance.

The result is a dynamic AI that is much more aware of the various unit class interactions, continuously trying to counter whatever the player is fielding.
