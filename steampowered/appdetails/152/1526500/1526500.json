Some enemies can change their elemental status to none, water, ice, or fire. Fire is strong against ice but weak against water, ice is strong water but weak against fire, and water is strong against fire but weak against ice. There is an implicit rule that enemies will always cast elemental spells that match their elemental defence. It allows you to know which elemental attack is best to use and which elemental defense is best to change to.<br><br>Apart from the gameplay, there is a small story foundation surrounding the levels of the game.
