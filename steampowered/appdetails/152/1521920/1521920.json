However, the greedy pirate Fallen Henry stands between Savvy and his success, attacking him for his ship and resources.  <br><br>In the thick of battle, the wicked pirate manages to tear off part of a real treasure map that miraculously ended up with Jack.

Of course, the settlers will also have to build bridges and roads, clear obstacles and sell the resources they collect. As well as building a farm, quarry and forest hut, you can also construct processing buildings, whose output is more expensive and better-suited for future production. For example, you can make bread from cornflower by building a special building and having a small amount of gold and an available worker. Every building can be torn down and replaced with a new one.
