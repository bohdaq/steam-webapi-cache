The game is set during the events of World War II.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe war took our heroes by complete surprise when nothing in their lives boded trouble.

Only one friend from their past serene life remained with them, a teddy bear.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHowever, fate is merciful to our brave kids, and they step by step overcome the difficulties of wartime, and they find themselves in all sorts of adventures, sometimes hilarious, and at times extremely dangerous and unpredictable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIngenuity is the best weapon of war!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo win not by numbers, but by skill, not by the power of iron, but by the power of thought.

She also knows how to cry, distracting the sentries, dulling their vigilance, while her younger brother stuns enemy soldiers by shooting at their helmets or breaks light bulbs on lampposts so that they could sneak by unnoticed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are many different abilities and each must be used wisely so that our heroes can find their way through all the mazes, bypass all the traps, and solve all the puzzles. Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of wartime, and join our heroes on their path of losses and victories, disappointments and triumphs, great fears and small joys, which have a place even in war. Penetrate enemy territories to commit sabotage. Distract sentries by dulling their vigilance, undermine trains, mine supply routes, steal important documents that store secret information, lure enemies into thickets and impenetrable swamps, derail columns of nazi equipment, and much more. Relive these moments with our heroes and help them find their loved ones, as well as keep faith in themselves and others!","about_the_game":"Grandmother's Tale is a 2D adventure game about the fate of two teenagers, brother and sister.
