In this series you will learn how to use the Unity 2D tilemap dynamically so that you develop a neat 2D construction system so that in game the player can place and remove tiles, and for the navmesh to update dynamically, and of course saving and loading that data to file and managing multiple save files. You will develop a day and night system and write AI that will respond to the time of day! These are fundamental topics to understand for developing Terraria like games, and what you learn in this series will be beneficial in many different projects especially for understanding how to save and load data to file and manage multiple save files. You can watch this series on YouTube, but this package has the added advantage of project folders for each video and of course the videos downloaded to your computer, plus you are directly supporting me when you buy this here on Steam and a lot of credit goes to my customers for helping me to keep GTGD going for 10 years.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why learn game development?<\/h2>I’m not sure I can tell you why you should learn game development, but I can tell you what I’ve found from my experience over the last ten years. I find developing my own games to be the most fun and it can be a challenging experience and amazing whenever I find myself developing new systems in code. My ability to think critically, solve problems, and learn new things has improved over the years and I do attribute some of this to experience gained from game development. It is also rewarding personally and financially that I can develop something, inspire people and also earn some income. Game development I think is a great way for earning passive income. Also, Unity is free to use so it makes it easy for me to develop with a very limited budget. Over the years several of my viewers have written to me to thank me and let me know that I helped inspire them to take a career in game development or software engineering and how happy they were. Those are mega highlights for me.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What you’ll learn<\/h2>These video tutorials are for beginner to intermediate level Unity developers and here’s what you’ll learn:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>How to code in C#<br><\/li><li>Setting up a new 2D project, understanding the interface and switching to Universal rendering.<br><\/li><li>Setting up tilemaps and bringing in tilemap extras.

Inside are also all of the video by video project folders so you have direct access to the code for debugging or direct usage if you’re a more advanced developer.
