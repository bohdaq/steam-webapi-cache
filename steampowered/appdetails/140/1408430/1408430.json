Whilst borrowing from [Lumines, Chime, Puyo Puyo, Tetris and Grave of the NecroDancer] means it feels familiar, it does also carry its own weight too.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/higherplaingames.com\/pc\/ekstase-game-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Higher Plain Games<\/a><br><br>“It’s absolutely brilliant. The only way I can describe it; it takes elements from Tetris &amp; Lumines without sticking to the rules of Tetris &amp; Lumines. It takes the music beats from both Lumines, Rez, Tetris Effect Connected and puts it in a blender, mixes it up with all the love and care of Nigella Lawson and produces an amazing action puzzle game that if you’ve played any action puzzle game, you get straight into this and get it.”<br><a

Gaming<\/a><br><br>“If you weren’t feeling energised beforehand, once the music starts you should start feeling much more awake and with it… the thumping beat urging you to make the most of your blocks.”<br>8.2 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.impulsegamer.com\/ekstase-switch-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Impulse
