The guild accepts commissions and quests from all walks of life firstly to promote the common good and secondly to grow as an association.

All heroes are unique with their characteristics, abilities, and dialogue. Should you recruit Rufus, the mighty macaque guardian that excels in traditional martial arts known to his people? Or Maryu, the heart-warming but savage old lady that can curse your opponents?<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1401560\/extras\/Grow_Your_Guild.gif?t=1657747396\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HONE YOUR LEADERSHIP<\/h2>Always check what enemies your party is going to face in the upcoming quests.
