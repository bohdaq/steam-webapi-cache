Our philosophy is <i>pay for convenience<\/i>, as long as it does not give you an unfair competitive edge.<br><br>The highest level you can achieve in the game today is Demigod (level 50), and quite a few of them have never spent money on Wyvern.

We strongly believe that Wyvern should be free and <i>fair<\/i> for people who don't want to spend money supporting us.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Learning Curve<\/h2><br>Unfortunately, Wyvern has a steep learning curve. It is a complex game with decades of history.  Our getting-started experience needs some love.  There is a starting tutorial, and we are working to improve it.
