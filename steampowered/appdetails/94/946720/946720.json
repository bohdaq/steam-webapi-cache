Olivia here from Little Rock Games and we need your help!<br><br>Throughout development of To The Rescue!, we did extensive research into dog shelters to make sure we accurately represented them as much as possible while still making a fun and genuine game. We now want to give back to those shelters and help those dogs still looking for a better life.<br><br>This is where we need help. We need your support to be able to give better lives to puppies as they wait to find their fur-ever home. With every purchase, we will be donating 20% of our profits to the Petfinder Foundation to do exactly that: help save the dogs!<br>Make sure to wishlist so you'll know when we launch so you too can help support and save puppy lives!<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/h7rQCNn3bj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/946720\/extras\/TTR-Discord-Banner.gif?t=1658348516\" \/><\/a><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/946720\/extras\/aboutthegame.gif?t=1658348516\" \/><br><br><i>To The Rescue!<\/i> is a dog shelter simulator where you are responsible for taking care of dozens of cute dogs in need of homes.
