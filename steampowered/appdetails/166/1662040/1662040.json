Death and destruction runs rampant, where nightmarish invaders sap the land of its very life force. Earth has become dry and barren and skies are covered by heavy clouds. Only the moon is still bright up above.

An immortal man locked into an endless cycle of death and rebirth. While he cannot die, the repeated trauma caused him to gradually lose memories, his name and even his purpose. He meets the so-called Patron, a shady traveler with mysterious powers. While powerful, he is deeply wounded and cannot travel by himself. The two come to an unwilling agreement. Wanderer will become the host for the Patron and he in turn will protect them. As when the world dies neither immortality nor power will mean anything.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1662040\/extras\/symbol.png?t=1649052290\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Combat<\/h2>Immersive, fast-paces, first-person combat. Tear enemies apart with claws and gradually acquire skills (such as time manipulation or ranged attacks). Each subsequent opponent will require appropriate tactic, and taking on too many enemies at once usually will result in a quick death. However, death is also a part of the mechanics – if felled, our immortal protagonist will use the experience to grow stronger and unlock new skills. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1662040\/extras\/walka.png?t=1649052290\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1662040\/extras\/szpony.jpg?t=1649052290\" \/>","about_the_game":"<strong>Dreamreaper is an action-adventure game in which you play as unwilling partners in the form of an immortal man and an alien entity parasitizing him.
