The sex scenes are not blurred or censored with all of the sex acts visible to the player.\r\n\r\nMost of the storylines in the game revolve around sexual interactions with other characters.\r\n\r\nBoneTown uses satire as humor and depicts many different cultures in satirical ways. This humor could be found offensive to culturally sensitive people.\r\n\r\nDrugs are used in BoneTown in place of magic, and anyone who finds the use of drugs offensive should not play this game."}}}}
