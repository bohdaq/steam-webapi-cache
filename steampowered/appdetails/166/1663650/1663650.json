I'm not afraid to say: you have infinite ways to complete a level. It is because we made the game physics as open and flexible as possible. Everything can happen: The video shows an unfortunate chain of events: knife hits the table, planks break, planks flying and hitting your friend towards the sawblade (which is a fail - but Hat Trick is completed).<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1663650\/extras\/downhillgif.jpg?t=1651615178\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1663650\/extras\/sawblade.jpg?t=1651615178\" \/><\/p><br><h1>CLICK BELOW TO JOIN US ON DISCORD<\/h1><p><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/MeGuz8gbsA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1663650\/extras\/steam-discord.jpg?t=1651615178\" \/><\/a><\/p><br><h1>TOTAL THROW CONTROL<\/h1><p>We developed a new throwing method for fun, but it worked out so well, we decided to make this game.
