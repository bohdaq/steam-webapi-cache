Set sail in any direction you want and explore islands filled with caves, ruins, pirate camps, and other mysterious places.

For one, we've put our focus on the single player exploration experience. You don't need friends to help you manage your boat or have to worry about being attacked by other players while exploring. This isn't a game focused on naval combat, but instead on PVE content such as exploring the sea at your own pace, going on quests, crafting powerful items, leveling up skill systems, and discovering interesting places and loot. A huge focus has also been put on making your ship your home at sea. We've added over 90 different ship decoration items you can place anywhere on your ship. We've also made the world procedurally generated so you can explore in any direction for as long as you want.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1574900\/extras\/Beached_Ship.gif?t=1658344753\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A World You Can Live In<\/h2><br>We wanted to a create world that you could not only get lost in, but live in. You set the pace of your adventure and decide what you want to do. Maybe you’re in the mood to go on epic quests and hunt down a world boss, or maybe you just want to relax on the shore with your fishing pole and catch some fish. Whatever it is, you get to play your way and have complete freedom in where you go and what you do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore an Infinite World<\/h2><br>Start in the middle of an infinite ocean with just you and your ship, pick a direction, and set sail across a procedurally generated world. Navigate the seas with a compass and sextant, using map coordinates as your guide to new locations. Discover uncharted islands with ruins, caves, pirate camps, seaports, and other mysterious places. Even though the islands are procedural, our points of interests are hand crafted with unique secrets, puzzles, and design. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1574900\/extras\/Ship_Customization_GIF.gif?t=1658344753\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Decorate Your Ship<\/h2><br>Your ship is your home at sea. While exploring the world you will find all kinds of items to craft and decorate your ship making it unique to you. You can place items virtually anywhere on your ship and customize it as you see fit. And you won’t need other people to help manage your ship. It’s just you, the sea, and the endless horizon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fish and Hunt to Survive<\/h2>You’ll need food to survive. Grab a fishing pole and toss a lure overboard to catch some fish or grab your bow and head into the woods to hunt some wildlife. Once you've got your ingredients, it's time to start cooking. With over 50 different meal recipes to discover, you'll constantly be on the lookout for a new recipe that will not only keep you alive, but give you passive benefits as well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Craft and Upgrade<\/h2><br>As you explore the world you will discover tons of resources that can be used to craft new items, armor, weapons, and decorations for your ship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Up<\/h2><br>Character progression is an important aspect of Salt 2. When you do different things like attack with a sword, you'll earn experience towards your slashing skill. Unlock talent trees for different skills and get unique perks for your characters as you level up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot Epic Gear<\/h2><br>Salt 2 features an RPG style loot system with different rarities of armor and weapons, and interesting stats to tailor to the play style you want. Each piece of gear also has randomized talents. So whether you are crafting a high level item, or hunting down a pirate captain for an epic sword, you'll always be searching for that new rare item with the perfect roll.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight Legendary Pirates<\/h2><br>The islands are full of dangerous enemies. Fight legendary pirates, bosses, and dangerous wildlife in your hunt for adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Go on Quests<\/h2><br>Dock your ship at a sea port and pick up quests and commissions from guilds, the townsfolk, and merchants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Lavaboots Studios<\/h2><br>We're a two man development team at Lavaboots and our goal is to make fun and exciting games that inspire adventure. We grew up loving games that dropped you in a big world and let you explore and discover things on your own. Our goal is to recreate that feeling and create worlds that give you the freedom to create your own path and lose yourself in the adventure.","about_the_game":"Salt 2 is an open world pirate game with a focus on exploration, crafting, and survival set in an infinite procedural world.
