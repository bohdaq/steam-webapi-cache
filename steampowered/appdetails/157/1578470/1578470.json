{"1578470":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Hide Seek Survive","steam_appid":1578470,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Experience true horror as a quiet night alone turns into the most dangerous game of hide and seek ever played. Find the doll seven times to win but be careful, there's something else inside the apartment looking for you too. Win or suffer a fate worse than death.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStep into the shoes of a lonely man who unfortunately decides to start a game of one man hide and seek. Search the eight rooms of his creepy apartment for the doll with your way lit by only his malfunctioning phone's flashlight. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour only friend in this cruel game is HideAndSeekSteve, who sends you voice messages every time you find the doll. These messages will give you anything from hints to encouragement throughout your journey.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe doll will move from room to room, giving away its location with a laugh, taunting you during this battle of life and death.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou will hear another set of footsteps moving throughout the apartment. This one leads to someone not of this world, who you definitely do not want to find you. You won't be able to see him until it is far too late...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo step into the apartment and see if you can win HideAndSeekSteve's game. Good luck...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNOTE: this game has been completely rebuilt from the ground up, rereleased in February of 2022. All reviews posted are of the old version which was poorly optimized and was not my best work. I spent a great deal reimagining the game's mechanics and optimizing performance. For example, I comfortably maintain the 150 FPS cap on my 2060 Laptop (I previously got 20 - 30 when the reviews were written).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBottom line is don't worry about the old reviews, this is a completely different game.","about_the_game":"Experience true horror as a quiet night alone turns into the most dangerous game of hide and seek ever played.
