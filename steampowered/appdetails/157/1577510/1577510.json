An abandoned village and community lies on the western shore near the old quay, while to the east a large broch stands forboding.  Mysterious standing stones on the southwest peninsula lead past esoteric statues, the origins of which are long lost.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou will come across unusual characters on your journey.  Uncover strange pasts, and hidden secrets and obtain the trust of those who might be able to help you. But be wary.  Is there something more going on under the surface?  Talk to people, get clues, solve puzzles and find out more as you interact with your environment in fully realized open world 3d.    <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs a lighthouse keeper, every day there are tasks to do.  One day cooking.  One day repairing the pumphouse in the village.  One day collecting supplies.  And always, always keeping the watch and keeping the lamp lit.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHow you solve problems is entirely up to you.  Will you take the gondola lift to the island?  Will you take a ride on a fishing boat?  Will you swim?  Will you quit and go home?  What other options are there?  Just journeying to meet Captain Malin for the first time, there are over ten ways you can approach this.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAi Ai Hastur Ftaghn!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHave you seen the Yellow Sign?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn your time off though, go exploring hunt for treasure, uncover mysteries, take beautiful photographs of your surroundings for your collection and learn forbidden secrets that allow you to travel between worlds in a sea of madness.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game tech.  Unreal Engine 5.  Using brand new Lumen and Nanite in UE5, The Wickie benefits from astounding lighting and color, presenting the island in all of its glory. All assets were built in-house or licensed, with some assets from the formidable Quixel Megascans.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game has been designed by industry veteran Cris Robson, a game dev with over 25 years experience, as well as being an authorized Epic Games Unreal Engine instructor and world-building AEC specialist.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTraditional artwork has been created by Mossy Moth Studios, with the personal style of Tabs showing through all of the artwork, with characters presented in 2d rather than 3d, making them stand out visually and tell a story in a way 3d characters can not.  Her unique designs bring the characters to life in a bold and beautiful manner, while still presented in full 3d.","about_the_game":"A first-person open-world adventure game using next-generation graphics and audio, powered by Unreal Engine 5.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn The Wickie; Journey of a lighthouse keeper, you journey to Pandora’s Rock, an island in the Outer Hebrides, to take up duty as a lighthouse keeper back in 1936.<br \/>\r\nOver a two-week period, you will perform the duties of a lighthouse keeper, while also uncovering mystery and adventure in this multi-layered isolated, magical, and mysterious yet breathtakingly beautiful remote Scottish paradise.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPandora’s Rock is 4km square, inhabited by beautiful local flora and fauna.
