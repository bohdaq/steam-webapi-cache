As a farmer, miner, fisher, warrior, craftsman, and even a mage, you’ll find that adventure awaits you here. Your hard work will let you upgrade your farm, restore shops in Sun Haven, and even bring in new neighbors! As you bring the hustle and bustle back to town, the EXP you earn from each quest will help you level up to advance through a main questline journey. The main quest itself takes you through two captivating towns outside of Sun Haven. The mythical Elven town of Nel’Vari rests deep in the forest where the Elves live in balance with nature. The rumored monster city of Withergate features a bustling nightlife that never ends - literally - since the city is covered in neverending darkness. Your experience in these places will grow your skills dramatically, but how you focus that growth is entirely up to you. If you prefer a sword in hand, then slash away by all means. But if a watering can is more your style, then there are nonviolent alternatives to overcome dangerous encounters - even with the final boss!
