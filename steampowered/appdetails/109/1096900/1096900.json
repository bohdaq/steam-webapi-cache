Coming up against such a challenge, perhaps most people have given up due to the difficulty involved.<br><br>That becomes quite a loss for the entire game industry, because from among the ideas discarded, there's bound to be creations that could lead to huge, earth-shattering hits.<br><br>The RPG Maker series was created to answer the wishes of all kinds of people who have found themselves saying, &quot;I want to make a game without learning programming,&quot; or &quot;Could anyone really make a game?&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Tool Designed to Make Games<\/h2>RPG Maker is known in Japan as &quot;RPG Tsukūru.&quot; &quot;Tsukūru&quot; is a coined term that, in a literal sense, combines the Japanese words for &quot;make&quot; and &quot;tool.&quot; This signifies that RPG Maker is a tool that is designed to make games. Within RPG Maker, we have already programmed the basic operations that support RPGs. Making an RPG is as easy as putting in the stats for your heroes and villains, drawing up some maps, and using a simple eventing system to drive the story to it's finale!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create an Original Game with Ease!<\/h2>Included with RPG Maker MZ, we have prepared a wealth of resources consisting of the visual art and music that are needed to make games. All you need to focus on is giving shape to your own ideas.
