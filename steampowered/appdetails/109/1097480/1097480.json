Everything for him changes when he meets a bisexual girl who gets ambushed by soldiers of the Empire. To help her, you must learn to use your magic, but on your quest to bring her home safe, you will have to journey into a dangerous frozen world.  Along the way, you will battle enemy soldiers, undead skeletons, and perhaps cross paths with seductive creatures of the frozen land while you unlock new erotic adventures with her.<br><br>So this is ultimately a game about living out a high fantasy adventure, with a strong emphasis on putting the player in control.
