Your actions and decisions define the solar system in that wars will be declared, famines will ravage populations, political legislation will be enacted upon planets and regions, among many other outcomes. Interact with diverse people from different backgrounds and professions to further your goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story<\/h2>In decades past, Earth became uninhabitable due to climate change and war. To maintain power, the planetary government of Earth proceeded to declare war for control of Mars. But they failed and left to find new territories to claim for their own. In the present day, Mars has only just recovered from the war. This could only be achieved due to the Merchants Guild that opened trading routes throughout the system. It provided Mars and the planetary colonies with essential resources that allowed them to expand and flourish. The system is rich in resources and humanity is eager to acquire as much of it as possible. It is your job as a merchant to continue this vital work.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your actions matter.<\/h2>The system is a blank canvas for you to impress your image upon.

The fragile structure that remains after the civil war is reliant on the merchants to transport resources to and from the colonies. But what does this mean for you, the player? <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> War - For as long as the resources flow across the system, to the colonies, then peace is maintained. Colonies will fight planetary and interplanetary wars over resources and territories. These wars can be lucrative but can also be disastrous for the movement of goods.<br><\/li><li> Death - For many colonies, their basic needs are met by the merchants. Food, water, oxygen, medical supplies, among other things cannot be produced on fledgling colonies without the resources or equipment to do it.

So this game will come with a modding tool that helps you to easily access its functions, allowing everyone the chance to mod the game with little or no knowledge of modding. But many of the games files are also easily accessible through configuration files allowing more flexibility for those who have experience. This has been done to make modding as easy and accessible as possible. We're also including written tutorials on how to access and use these features. You'll be able to create your own ships, planets, items, people, quests, and more.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Merchants of Sol<\/h2>Is a strategy game that entails making as much money as possible using any method at your disposal.
