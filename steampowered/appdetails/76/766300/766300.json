By the use of several Mazes, each one can be taken for a certain sound element. <br \/>\r\nThe Mazes list allows switching Mazes on\/ off immediately, same as the instrument channels in a DAW.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPATTERNS: PROCESS-ORIENTED WORKFLOW<br \/>\r\nEvery session starts with the first pattern. A Pattern includes the current Mazes on the screen, their on\/off values, the tempo and the Grid type.<br \/>\r\nThe way of composing follows the process of cloning and transforming the first pattern, or adding a new pattern to start from scratch.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMAIN FX &amp; RECORDING<br \/>\r\nThe main audio effect controller comes up with a Filter-Echo, Filter-Reverb, Flanger &amp; Reverser. <br \/>\r\nThe Main FX gives easy options for live improvisations, for Pattern transitions or session recordings.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTHE BASIS<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTHE GRID<br \/>\r\nThe main synthesizer in Soniface is related to a Grid. Spread across the screen, each line is related to a tone. Grid types differ in the number of tones.<br \/>\r\nUse multitouch to activate the Grid-Synth. In addition, the Grid visualizes certain instruments and effects.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGRID-SYNTH: SOUND &amp; SHAPE<br \/>\r\nA simple finger tap on the Maze point in the centre will give you access to the Grid-Synth Sound Interface.<br \/>\r\nThe controller points work in relation to their arc and radius e.g. Wave for volume &amp; frequency. Each controller can be automated.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCOLOR &amp; CHORDS<br \/>\r\nThe Color Interface defines the pitch of Grid-Synth, the Bass Synth and the Granular Harmonizer. A ring around the 24 keynotes is a sequencer. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSAMPLER: EDITOR, LIBRARY &amp; SEQUENCER<br \/>\r\nThe Sampler provides recorded soundspaces and instruments, which can be looped by In&amp;Out points and sliced with the Sequencer. <br \/>\r\nBy activating the GridSound function a Sample becomes the base of the Grid-Synth. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSAMPLER: GRANULAR SYNTH<br \/>\r\nExtending the Sampler module the Granular module lets you generate and model new sounds out of samples. <br \/>\r\nTherefore it’s sliced into small audio grains to organically stretch the sound endlessly. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRHYTHM: SEQUENCING &amp; MODULATION <br \/>\r\nThe Rhythm Interface is for drum loops and bass lines. Different quantisation options allow to set various rhythms. The sound modulation offers controllers to create a hybrid sound of drum sample and synth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRHYTHM: BASS-MODE, SOUND FX &amp; ENVELOPES<br \/>\r\nBy turning on the BassMode button the sequencer switches and bass notes can be placed. <br \/>\r\nThe Bass envelopes provide the change of volume, filter and pitch. The effects section provides high- and lowpass, echo, chorus &amp; distortion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHYPERFACE CONTROLLER: GRID-SYNTH, SAMPLER &amp; RHYTHM<br \/>\r\nThe Hyperface can be used by multitouch for sequencing drum steps, dynamic envelopes, filters curves &amp; audio effects at different sequence speeds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBLUETOOTH &amp; ABLETON LINK <br \/>\r\nSoniface supports playback via Bluetooth devices. Ableton Link can be used for synchronization with other music apps.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nABOUT MAZETOOLS<br \/>\r\nDeveloped by Stephan Kloss since 2011, the apps combine music and technology in artistic practice. <br \/>\r\nFollowing a musical approach that focuses the process of making sound, many enthusiasts pushed the project with feedback.
