Each human character also has a face graphic, and sixteen of them have fully animated side-view battlers so they can be used as heroes. Each monster has an overworld walking sprite as well as a image to be used in side-view combat. On top of that, extra character sets are included for cars, vehicles, treasure chests, switches, and special effects.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six tilesets-- including autotiled water, terrain and buildings-- provide a variety of options for creative locations. Forests, caves, towns and cities are a given-- there's also tiles for a school, a science lab, a fast-food restaraunt, bathrooms, and more. House and building tiles can be mix-and-matched for even more options in creating your game world. Also included: a huge set of icons for items, weapons, equipment, etc.\r\n\r\nOMEGA MODERN also has the system graphics needed to keep your game looking good with a single consistent style: emotion balloons, animated state icons, and even four different window skins. All of it is designed to work together!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* Over 100 overworld character sprites\r\n* 26 tilesets! Interiors and exteriors-- towns, cities, forests, dungeons!\r\n* 50 monsters-- with overworld sprites and battle graphics\r\n* Side-view battlers and face graphics for hero characters\r\n* Icon set with 170+ icons for items, food, equipment, etc\r\n* System graphics to match the pixel style: balloon, states, weapons, and window skins!\r\n\r\nTerms of Use:\r\n\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects\r\n* Contents can be edited\r\n* OK for use in games with gore\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","about_the_game":"This collection includes everything you need to build a full game in a single style: characters, battlers, faces, tilesets, monsters, icons, and even system graphics.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOMEGA MODERN includes over one hundred character sprites, and that isn't even counting the animals, aliens or robots.
