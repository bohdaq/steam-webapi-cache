{"1817170":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Indie Rumble","steam_appid":1817170,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OVERVIEW<\/h2>Indie Rumble is an indie crossover platform fighting game featuring iconic gaming characters. With 15 fully playable characters, 30 stages, and ~35 music tracks, Indie Rumble is looking to be a fun and new crossover fighter to represent indie video games and media.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTERS<\/h2>Indie Rumble's goal is to gather the biggest indie gaming icons together into one massive all-out fighter. With characters such as Peppino (Pizza Tower), Captain Viridian (VVVVVV), Alex (YIIK: A Post-Modern RPG), and 12 more full fighters, we already feel we've done a fantastic job. Each character features a moveset hand-crafted to fit their character from the source material designed for this fighting game. On top of this, each character receives a home stage and music tracks to boot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NEW MECHANICS<\/h2>Indie Rumble features new mechanics such as a Rumble Meter, akin to EX Moves in traditional fighters. Along with these new game-changing mechanics, we allow wavedashing, DI, and everything else you'd expect in a competitive platform fighter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Easy to Pick Up, Hard to Master<\/strong> - Anyone can pick up a controller and play Indie Rumble. It is easy to understand, but not at the cost of the players who want a more advanced experience. We have balanced a fine line between needing to learn tech and just being able to play.<br><\/li><li><strong>Local &amp; Online Versus<\/strong> - Duke it in 1v1s, and up to 4 players can battle in a free-for-all, both locally and online in Indie Rumble.<br><\/li><li><strong>Rollback Netcode<\/strong> - Indie Rumble features rollback netcode. To us, this was a requirement. We know how important it is to both casual and competitive players in the FGC to feature rollback netcode. Indie Rumble features the smoothest possible online experience we can provide.<br><\/li><li><strong>Full Voice Acting<\/strong> - We feel some fighting games lacking voice acting also lack life. Because of this, adding voice acting was essential. Indie Rumble features full voice acting for every character.<br><\/li><li><strong>Team Battles<\/strong> - We offer a mode to duke it out in 2v2s and more! There is also a toggle for Team Attack.<br><\/li><li><strong>Full High-Quality Soundtrack<\/strong> - We have a full, high-quality 35+ soundtrack from incredible composers featuring both remixes of familiar tracks, and original compositions.<br><\/li><li><strong>Training Mode<\/strong> - While Indie Rumble was designed and focused on multi-player content, we have a training mode where you can play against CPUs, showing hitboxes, hurt boxes, DI angles, and more!<br><\/li><li><strong>Modding<\/strong> - We allow and encourage full modding support for the Steam Version of Indie Rumble.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW TO PLAY<\/h2>Indie Rumble is a 2D platform fighting game. As you attack your opponent, you build up their percentage. The higher one's percentage, the further they get knocked back. The goal is to launch them off of the stage. Each character has a variety of ~24 unique moves each to utilize. Use a combination of your Attacks, Specials, Strongs, Shield, Grabbing\/Throwing, and Aerials to launch your foes into the blast zone!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY<\/h2>Indie Rumble features full platform fighter movesets for each character. This means every single character has 5 aerials, 4 specials, 4 rumbles, 4 throws, 3 smash attacks, 3 tilts, a jab, a dash attack, and a taunt. There are also no gimmicks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STAGES<\/h2>Indie Rumble features a full 30 stages! That's one for each fighter and 10 more! With this, we're able to represent games such as SUPERHOT, which we otherwise wouldn't have. We incentivize fair and fun gameplay in our stages. Most of the stages were made with competitive play in mind. However, we have a handful of casual stages as well. We think it should always be up to the community to decide which stages are legal and which are illegal for competitive play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OUR ROSTER<\/h2>Indie Rumble features:<br><br>Rhythm Knights <strong>(Rhythm Knights)<\/strong><br>Peppino <strong>(Pizza Tower)<\/strong><br>Captain Viridian <strong>(VVVVVV)<\/strong><br>Yolk <strong>(Leap Day)<\/strong><br>Alex <strong>(YIIK: A Post-Modern RPG)<\/strong><br>Chubby <strong>(Mission in Snowdriftland)<\/strong><br>Tough Love Fighters <strong>(Tough Love Arena)<\/strong><br>Crow <strong>(Nefarious)<\/strong><br>Welltaro <strong>(Downwell)<\/strong><br>Brian <strong>(Yuppie Psycho)<\/strong><br>Spark <strong>(Spark the Electric Jester)<\/strong><br>Chizuru <strong>(Super Ledgehop: Double Laser)<\/strong><br>Ding <strong>(Wanba Warriors)<\/strong><br>The Kid <strong>(I Wanna Be The Guy)<\/strong><br><br>Whether you are a fan of indie titles, platform fighters, or both, this game will have something for you.
