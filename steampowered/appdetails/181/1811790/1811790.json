Coming with the Elusive Menace DLC, this nimble Tier VI American tank destroyer is ready to cause a lot of trouble for the unfortunate enemies who happen to encounter it on the battlefield. Good alpha damage and great gun depression angles topped up with decent maneuverability and fully traversable turret makes the T78 a well-rounded tank destroyer capable of dealing with various battle challenges. Watch out for enemy shells though—with such thin armor, every hit you take will be a hard one.<br><br><strong>Firepower:<\/strong> The T78’s 90 mm gun deals a respectable 240 HP of damage per shot, and its 160 mm of penetration allows you to put that damage output to good use. With a rather comfortable reload time of 8.3 seconds, you can easily punish enemy vehicles that dare to enter your view range. Gun depression angles of –10°\/+20° allow you to effectively utilize the terrain and remain out of range of your opponents’ shells. And don’t forget the fully traversable turret, giving you that extra flexibility and maneuverability in the battle.<br><br><strong>Speed:<\/strong> Speaking of maneuverability, this vehicle performs pretty well in those “catch me if you can” scenarios on the battlefield. Find a nice firing spot, rain down some shells on the enemy force, and move on to the next position, using your top speed of 55 km\/h. Use your mobility to your advantage and stay elusive and dangerous.<br><br><strong>Protection:<\/strong> Don’t count on this vehicle’s armor. Your best protection is to remain unseen by the enemy—reposition quickly, hide in the bushes, use the terrain, and remember that you have great signal range, which means that you can stay on the second or even third line of the battle, sniping the opponents spotted by your allies.<br><br>The vehicle comes with a 100% trained crew and a commander with Sixth Sense, as well as some additional treats—projection decals to decorate your vehicles for Christmas, the Armored Train 2D style, and two unique crew members—Alexandra Ostrovskaya and Holly Byron—each with Brothers in Arms as a zero perk and enough XP for one extra skill of your choice.
