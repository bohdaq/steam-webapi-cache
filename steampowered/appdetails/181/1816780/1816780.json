Click on the info panel to see their reason for traveling and make sure that everyone gets their seat. otherwise, they’ll have to wait for the next train (and be frustrated, nobody likes to miss the train).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNew tracks - Click and drag to create tracks that connect your stations. Tracks will be elevated allowing your rovers and drones to pass underneath together with power cables, while pipes can cross over them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSame train, different cargo - Traveling on the red planet has never been safer (and efficient!).
