While Wildfrost battles are turn-based, cards don’t attack every turn. Instead they have a ‘counter’ which counts down the amount of turns until they’re ready to automatically make their move! <br><br>By keeping an eye on enemy monsters’ counters, you can plot ahead your perfect play. Buff your companions? Stall an enemy attack? Or maybe count down your own timer to wreak havoc fast! It’s up to you to strategically turn the tide in your favour. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1811990\/extras\/Wildfrost_GIF_Rebuild.gif?t=1654176755\" \/><br><br>Need a rest? Take shelter in the cosy town of Snowdwell. Here survivors have gathered to keep warm using the power of the Luminice, a giant shard of hot ice. <br><br>As you progress after each run you’ll be able to return and gradually help expand the hub town itself, constructing buildings such as a Pet Shop, Inventors Hut and more! These new areas will unlock fun and useful new things to use during your adventures, with new cards, tribes, cosmetics, challenges to complete, and events to encounter. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1811990\/extras\/Wildfrost_GIF_Replay.gif?t=1654176755\" \/><br><br>Think you’ve defeated the Frost Guardian?
