These games are not listed in order and will appear randomly when playing.\r\n\r\nDdakji - The aim of the game is for one player to make the other player’s tile flip over on the floor.\r\n\r\nRed light, Green light - Players must stop when red light is announced, they may go when green light is announced, you will have 5 minutes to get across the courtyard.\r\n\r\nHide and Seek - players must hide from the seeker in various locations, those who are found are eliminated.\r\n\r\nCapture the Flag - there are a set number of flags hidden in a large area, the first players to get these flags and make it to the safezone are able to escape. the flag count changes depending on playercount.\r\n\r\nThe Floor is Lava - players must hop from one platform to the other, those who touch the ground are eliminated.\r\n\r\nHoneycomb - Various shapes are carved into honeycomb disks, you must use a needle to carefully retrieve the shape from the disk without breaking the honeycomb.\r\n\r\nTug of War - Players must use strategy and strength to pull a rope to their side of the towers, failure to do so as a team will result in death.\r\n\r\nMarbles - Players pair up and must play one of a few marble related games, betting marbles as they go. The winner will be the first player to get 20 marbles and will move onto the next game.\r\n\r\nGlass Bridge - Players are presented with a large bridge divided into 2 paths. Each path has a thin line of glass, some are tempered and can support the weight of 2 players, the others can’t even support one player, you must use your wits and luck to make it to the other side.\r\n\r\nThe Finale - this will be one of many hidden games but will vary depending on player count, more about this game will be told to players at the time of the game to keep things fair.<\/p><br><h1>The Goal<\/h1><p>You may look at the dangers, the horrific killings and near impossible odds and think, why bother?\r\n\r\nMoney.\r\n\r\neverybody loves money. money brings happiness. Those who have the most money are cast at the top of the leaderboard. You can enter the game more than once and your money will always be there... Unless you die.\r\n\r\nCan you risk losing it all after you have worked so hard for it? How many times can you handle going into the game?<\/p><br><h1>The Customisation<\/h1><p>Not only can you choose your character and customise appearance. This game also allows for the customisation of suits and clothing items too. in our universe the game is looked at as more of a sport rather than shady hidden red room. With sponsors, merchandising and live viewings from across the world, you are encouraged to draw attention to yourself. After all it’s nice to know that people where rooting for you right as you fall to your death right?<\/p><br><h1>The Challenge<\/h1><p>This game is not for the lighthearted, you are put with 100 random people each time you play. Each death is permanent and you will lose all progress when dying. You could lose billions of dollars, all of your respect and probably a keyboard or two if you get mad. Play at your own risk and remember to have fun.<\/p><br><h1>How can I take part?<\/h1><p>Join the discord server found in the official Steam community group listed below and await further instructions…<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>100 players awake in a room alongside a prize of $1 Billion.
