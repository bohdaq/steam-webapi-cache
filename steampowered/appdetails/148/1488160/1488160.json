We are an indie design studio and will work to fix any and all bugs as soon as they are reported. Thank you for your support and understanding as we release our very first title! Happy Gaming!<\/i><br><br><br>The Deed of Deception starts as a 3+ player cooperative puzzle game. Working together to find the deed and inherit your fortune. Once the deed is discovered the players realize that there is no inheritance to be had. There is something in this manor. Something ancient, something…evil. The player who finds the deed becomes possessed. Given special abilities and powers with the singular mission of trapping their friends and stealing their souls to fuel the evil in this place. The gameplay changes based on the type of possession the manor decides to use. Each variation offers different abilities. Sometimes using the element of deception to trick or brute strength to overpower. The souls of those who have been trapped try to help any way they can. Maybe giving items, or hints.

Uncle Barnabas sadly met his maker. Before he left this plane, he designed several puzzles and challenges to test his relatives and find a fit heir to take possession of his fortune.

But you go because, why not? The promise of riches is far too tempting to let go…<br><br>The deed is more than paper and ink. It is something ancient. Something …. Evil. Promising possession of unimaginable riches but the possession is not of things. IT, this place, possesses you. Manifesting the evil within these walls into the poor soul who stumbles upon and awakens it. This manor means to unleash the evils from other dimensions into our world.
