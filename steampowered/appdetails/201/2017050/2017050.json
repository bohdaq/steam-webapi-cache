This game combines a first-person survival game with a building and fighting strategy from a bird's perspective. In this game, you will need to mine resources, build objects (automatization) and survive. You will become the emperor of your Colony. But it's not that easy, you have to work for it. You have to grow and then your population will grow as well. You may be an aggressive king or a kind one, you are setting the rules. It's up to you if you're going to attack other colonies to get their resources or you will explore other islands on your own. Can you and your friends become the best colony in the Colony world?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game basics<\/strong><\/h2>Automatization, logistics, colony strategy, and economic distribution are the main things that will help you become the best. If you can master those, you will be the best. You have to decide, where to build the exact buildings. You have to define the logistic system for transporting items to other buildings. And the most important thing, your citizens. They should be happy to be more productive. You will have to build them a school to educate them or a park to let them have fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Building system<\/strong><\/h2>You will start with nothing. You have to mine your first resources and then you can build a new building, that will be able to produce new items, which you can use to craft new resources or build other buildings. There are a few types of buildings. You can build productive buildings, defense, educative or recreational. Every type will give you something else.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>War system<\/strong><\/h2>One of the interesting game aspects is fighting other colonies. If you have a strong army you can challenge some other colony to fight. If they accept, you will arrive at their island and plan the attack. You can manage your army into groups and control every group separately. For example, one group can go to building A and another can go to building B. You are controlling the fight from a bird's view. On the other side, if you are defending, you should have strong defense buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Environment<\/strong><\/h2>You created a new world and now you are standing there in the middle of nowhere. Around you is only a beautiful forest and water. Animals will come to you to say hi and then... you hit them. It's cruel, but you have to survive. You will realize, that you don't have anything but nature around you and that's the key because that's everything you need. You will need to eat, drink and sleep to survive. Every colony is on a different island. Every island has different resources. So you will need Cartography building to find new islands with new resources and colonize them, then you will need a harbor to transport the items to your main island, where you can process them. Eventually, the Earth will be small to you, so you will fly up to space and your adventure may continue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiplayer<\/strong><\/h2>Do you have friends? And do you want them to play with you? No problem! You can play with up to 4 players. Every player can have a different role in your colony. If you have a very smart friend, he can be the head of the researchers. Is your friend a fighter? Then he can be an army general. With friends is everything better. You will cooperate on your journey to becoming the best.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What to expect?<\/strong><\/h2>Imagine a place, where everything is exactly as you want - that's Colony.
