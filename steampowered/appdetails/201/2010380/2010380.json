Players that have survived for several days at least, have enough stamina to explore other villages and to get out of the starting area. However, if you are one of the first in an undiscovered village, you will be able to claim it and make use of its resources to stock up your supplies that you can use to acquire followers and other players that join your tribe to protect you and to make you more powerful.

Only 5% of players are expected to survive for longer than a month, only 1% for longer than several months.. Players cannot survive on their own for more than a few weeks, but need to build support network around them to help during times of injury and for protection against players that have formed bandit tribes.<br><br>Make sure to use your real-life social skills to deploy in the cylinder and make friends via proximity-based voice chat.
