The demo is much more gentle, than the main game, but still it contains fighting, killing, robbing. \r\n\r\nIn addition, in younger players, it may lead to the conclusion that robbing someone is fun and a right thing to do. Please keep your children out of this game or make sure they understand it is only a game."}}}}
