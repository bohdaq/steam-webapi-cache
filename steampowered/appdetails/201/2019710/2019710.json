The graphics are excellent, with smooth animation and although I seemed to be running around the maze doing nothing for quite some time. Gift From The Gods is totally absorbing, interesting and fun.”<br \/>\r\n90% – ZX Computing (June 1985)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“If you like Avalon then you'll love Gift from the Gods - it is great fun to play and you never know just what you are going to find around the next corner!”<br \/>\r\n85% – Computer and Video Games (March 1985)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“Gift from the Gods is without doubt the best game that has ever come out with Imagine connected somewhere to it. The graphics are very good and the animation of the various monsters and yourself is excellent. The game is colourful and the overall presentation is marvellous. Gift from the Gods is fun to play and, offering challenges to players of all sorts — you don’t have to be an arcade wiz to get from room to room, but you have to be quite good at games if you want to complete the game.”<br \/>\r\n84% – Crash!
