For example, if you chose the Fast Mode for the Speed X Strength combat mode, you will increase the chance to land a (weaker) hit, but if the defender is strong and performs a Repelling Defense, you will get staggered, which will increase the chance of receiving a hit, so this choice should take into consideration the features of your enemy.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Animations and visual effects<\/strong>: these will get special attention. Animations are strongly interconnected with combat mechanics (i.e., if you dodge an attack, the animation shows a dodge, if you block, the animation shows a block). Most combat animations are high quality motion capture animations. Visual effects will also be coherent to the spell behavior (i.e., effect increases with spell power).<\/li><\/ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Large number of classes, special abilities<\/strong> (including modes and configurations), providing a large number of builds. This is a highly tactical component when creating your build, allowing to create extremely powerful characters, if you do the smart choices.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Overpowering X challenging combat<\/strong>: the combat is expected to be challenging (but not unforgiving as dark souls), and rewarding, specially if you succeed in creating a powerful character.

The setting is in a world created and governed by a pantheon of gods, who have their own philosophical alignment and intend to shape the world accordingly to it. In a nutshell, their philosophy is a manifestation of the Good X Evil - Order X Chaos quartet. This quartet is a manifestation of an even more fundamental binary principle of reality (similar to the yin and yang of a Chinese philosophy). These principles will be shown to be present in many aspects of reality, from macro to micro scale, including in spells, abilities, and classes (and here we have a connection between the lore and the gameplay).<\/li><\/ul><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Story<\/strong>: although the focus is on gameplay, the story is also being considered important. Almost all the quests are directly or indirectly strongly related to the main story quest. You will not have to spend too much time reading dialogues and having to understand and solve the problems of others, as you will be focused on solving your own problems.
