Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls &quot;Mr. Riggs&quot;, can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat.

It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough.

Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe.

The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world.
