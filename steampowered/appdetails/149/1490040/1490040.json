{"1490040":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"dlc","name":"Masters of Puzzle - Dream of Arcadia by Thomas Cole","steam_appid":1490040,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"detailed_description":"It's time that we started a new classical collection of puzzles and our first is based on the painting <strong>Dream of Arcadia<\/strong> by classical painter <strong>Thomas Cole<\/strong>*. The theme of Dream of Arcadia is man’s relationship to unspoiled nature. Cole felt that the American wilderness was beginning to disappear as a result of the industrialization of the nation. In this painting, Cole harks back to the land of Arcadia, a rustic, secluded area of ancient Greece. The people who lived in Arcadia led simple, happy lives, in harmony with nature. Cole creates an idyllic image of an unblemished landscape - one where people frolic in the trees, sheep roam the hillside, and children play in the gentle river. Cole was greatly inspired by the work of Claude Lorrain, a French landscape artist who painted roughly 200 years before him. “Claude, to me, is the greatest of all landscape painters,” said Cole. Cole used many of the same artistic devices that Claude used in his paintings, such as the luminous distance, the large trees in the foreground that frame the painting, and elements of architecture in the middle ground. Claude often emphasized the effects of light in his paintings - something Cole focused on as well in Dream of Arcadia.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1490040\/extras\/banner7.png?t=1612450941\" \/><br>Contains <i>one<\/i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle playable in variations of <i>250<\/i>, <i>500<\/i>, <i>750<\/i>, and <i>1000<\/i> puzzle tiles.
