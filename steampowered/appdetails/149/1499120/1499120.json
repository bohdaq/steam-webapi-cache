It's funnier, wittier, and spy-ier than the original, oftentimes feeling like it was cut from the same cloth as classic 70s Bond films in many ways ‚Äî sans the fairly inappropriate female antagonist names, of course.‚Äù<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/i-expect-you-die-2-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Android Central<\/a><br><br>‚ÄúThe best thing I can say about my first few hours with I Expect You To Die 2 is that it's just more I Expect You To Die.
