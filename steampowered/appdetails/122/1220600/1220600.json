We use a flexible grid system which allows you to make fields in any angle and direction, placing plots close to already existing ones will put them in the same grid. We are planning different crop plot types and shapes allowing for extra freedom when creating your garden. Our special grass system will allow for large flower gardens and wheat fields in custom shapes.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/cooking.gif?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br>* <strong>Cooking System [IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> allows you to make your custom recipes using any viable ingredient for each recipe. Wanna make a banana and strawberry soup? you can! Every single one of the 120+ recipes are extremely flexible. If you find a good combination you can save your custom recipes and even share with other players by exporting it as XML files! And if balancing the different types of tastes, aromas and nutrients is too overwhelming for you, just use the recipe book which comes with sample recipes or import recipes from other players.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/building.gif?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br>* <strong>Building your home [IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> You can create a small farmstead or a huge castle, place cooking stations, plant crops in vases, add furniture and upload to the workshop! Share your buildings or download other player's creations, the building system will be expanded further when animals are added so coops and barns can be built for your animals..<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/build_building.gif?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br>* <strong>Modding Support [IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> The game comes with a mod loader and a built-in tool for simple mod creation, most of the game content can be manipulated through easy to read XML files and scripting is supported for more robust mods.<br><br>* <strong>Edengrall Citizens [18\/40 MODELED]<\/strong> are mostly girls and many of them will be eligible for marriage, will you fall in love? or just stay as friends? We are planning for over 40 characters, each with their own personality, tastes, responsibilities and tasks. We want to create more realistic and flexible behavior for our NPCs instead of fixed schedules. We are also planning to use artificial intelligence instead of scripted events. Our girls will remember previous events and actions, will comment on your development and will spread information organically by talking to each other.<br><br>* <strong>Faerie Helpers<\/strong> will give you a hand. After you unlock access to the Faeries you can manage their village and once you gain their trust they will start helping you in your farm. Do not underestimate Faerie magic, they are excellent helpers despite their size. Just make sure to prepare plenty sweets for them as payment, no one works for free!<br><br>* <strong>Livestock and Pets<\/strong> are going to be quite basic at first, but we want to expand this feature on later expansions, adding breeding (genes and inherited traits), butchering (meat!!!) and training.<br><br>* <strong>Fishing, Foraging and Insect Catching<\/strong> will be all be viable alternatives to farming, but nothing will stop you from doing all of those activities as long as you have time and stamina for all of them. While foraging and insect hunting will be quite simple, we have plans for a deeper fishing system.<br><br>* <strong>Exploring the Island [1% IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> will be quite time consuming. We are planning a very large world and camping in the wild will be required if you venture too far. Make sure you take enough supplies, as there are survival mechanics in this game and you can die from hunger!<br><br>* <strong>Daily activities limited more by stamina than time<\/strong>, instead of following the common one real life second = one ingame minute we will have a much longer day so you don't have to rush, and you can actually relax while playing. Regenerating stamina will require taking naps after eating and balanced meals will be very important to keep Adam working at full capacity, so keep an eye on nutritional value.<br><br>* <strong>Supply &amp; Demand Economy [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> Prices on good and services will be based on supply and demand. Each NPC will have needs and wants, and their purchases will be based on that. But demand can be created, if you want to sell a specific crop just make a good recipe that uses it and hand out some free samples! Trends and word of mouth will cause prices on all items to change, not just yours.<br><br>* <strong>Festivals of Prosperity<\/strong> will happen on the second and last week of each season, but only if the city has spare resources. If Edengrall does through hard times don't expect a cooking festival or feast in the end of the month. If the NPCs are not managing to get the festivals running you can donate resources and gain more voting power when the citizens are voting which will be the next festival.<br><br><strong>Meet the Citizens<\/strong><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Adam.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Sasha.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Elly.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Reiko.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Karen.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Fuko.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Meru.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Momo.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Mint.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Marie.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Bianca.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Lucca.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Yui.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Anna.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Tiana.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Catarina.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Yukari.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/Eduron.png?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br>Other features like Alchemy, Combat, Mining and Dungeon diving are planned, but will be released later in expansions.","about_the_game":"You play as Adam, a retired adventurer, despite being an outsider and having no claims in the island, he is invited to live in Edengrall.<br>Despite going through hard times recently there is still a strong sense of community in the city, join the citizens of Edengrall and work hard to pay back for their hospitality!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/grass_cut.gif?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br><strong>Features<\/strong><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1220600\/extras\/farming.gif?t=1656462100\" \/><br><br>* <strong>Farming System [IMPLEMENTED]<\/strong> lets you build your fields anywhere as long as the land is not already owned by someone else.
