{"850870":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"mod","name":"Hard-Life","steam_appid":850870,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"detailed_description":"Hard-Life is a mod that aims to change how you play Half-Life. The game was difficult back in 1998 but we've all nearly memorized enemy patterns and locations. Rather than raising enemy health and damage in an artificial manner, we decided to overhaul how the the AI works. Enemies are more evasive, they move quicker, react faster, and are more deadly with their aim.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHuman enemies work more efficiently together to flush you out, and now bring a wide assortment of firepower with them to give you a tough time in every situation. Aliens are more aggressive and more willing to hit and run the player.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAdditional enemies have also been hand-placed throughout the game to keep up the pressure, but without drastically changing the game's native pacing. There are also some new additions to the Half-Life cast, but they should all be familiar places.<br \/>\r\nAside from increasing the general difficulty of the game, we also decided to implement extra features to the game that we feel fit the original tone, or were even reflected in concept art. Allies can be equipped with heavier firepower, and come in more forms and the same goes for your enemies too. We wanted to introduce variation to every scenario so that no firefight ever feels the same as the last.<br \/>\r\nWe're also making an effort to unify assets in the game so that the world feels more cohesive. Weapons will now match in their world and player versions, and will seem a bit more functional as well. Many features added to the game should not be overly noticeable and you may find yourself wondering if certain elements were always there or added by Hard-Life.","about_the_game":"Hard-Life is a mod that aims to change how you play Half-Life.
