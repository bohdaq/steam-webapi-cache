Since you only got few mods at the beginning, it's not too complicated. For instance you will have to adept to certain statuses enemies have like &quot;Flying&quot;. So it's a good idea to learn &quot;Long-distance attack&quot;. Over time it'll get more complex and interesting interdependencies between the different mods and even characters emerge. Across all characters there are around <strong>80 Mods<\/strong> to choose from!<br>Another interesting one is &quot;<strong>Blitzblow<\/strong>&quot;. It costs some MP but in exchange there is no Damage Trigger and you hit the enemy with regular damage. Useful, if an enemy is super fast and you can't seem to hit them.

This will result in triggering the Counterattack with 2 hits (Doubleslash). Additionally Dark Companion adds more damage and the dark element to every hit. Very strong for instance against the earth elemental WienerWorm. :D<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1037460\/extras\/WienerWurm_1.gif?t=1658937508\" \/><br><br><strong>Summons<\/strong><br>Chloe is the only character who can use summons.

But over the time you can make it easier by learning certain skills. For instance &quot;Hunting&quot; that will result in healing a certain amount of HP after every battle.

They use a weapon called Pluz-Cannon to vaporize several planets and raid others with ground forces. Now they are planning on destroying Lisarya with one big bang as well, but they ran out of the rare mineral Pluz, which fuels their cannon. As soon as they find a new source for it, they will fill their cannon with it and blow up Lisarya within an instant.

For that purpose the unlikely duo Ramirez and Meling are sent to an abandoned base of the Droons, where they are searching for weapons and other useful stuff.<br><br>With constant tension between them, many awkward situations and in danger of being extinguished at any given second, the story begins.","about_the_game":"You can start by playing the free demo (3-4 hours) and if you like it buy the game and transfer your save file.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 25-30 hours of playtime<br><\/li><li> classic sideview turn-based battle system with a focus on tactics and a modern twist<br><\/li><li> complex skill system<br><\/li><li> high quality artworks rendered in Blender<br><\/li><li> jumping-system with timing, grab and flip-funktion<br><\/li><li> individual gameplay mechanics for every area<br><\/li><li> experimental soundtrack<br><\/li><li> traveling inbetween planets<br><\/li><li> panty looting (yes, you actually collect panties, there is a deeper meaning tho xD)<br><\/li><li> tons of secrets, easter eggs, cameos and sidequests<br><\/li><li> cinematic cutscenes<br><\/li><li> Superbosses<br><\/li><li> Easy Mode<\/li><\/ul><br>Please look at the website for a presskit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle System<\/h2><br><strong>Damage Trigger<\/strong><br>A central mechanic is what I call the Damage Trigger.
