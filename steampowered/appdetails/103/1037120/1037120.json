And it will be quite deserved, because it's just a very good production. So if you like the atmosphere in the style of &quot;Stargate&quot; (mainly film), interesting puzzles, good humor, finding references to pop culture works and a good audio - visual setting, this title is for you. I heartily recommend.&quot;<\/i><br><strong>9\/10<\/strong> - <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/forum.przygodomania.pl\/viewtopic.php?f=1302&amp;t=7732\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >forum.przygodomania.pl, Poland<\/a><br><br><\/li><li><i>&quot;'Mutropolis' offers us eight to ten hours of gameplay in a lovingly created world inhabited by unique and charming characters. The classic point-and-click has a wonderful balance between story and puzzles and really won me over after a short time. It's tricky and challenging, but not impossible to solve. It is hard for me to avoid spoliers this time, as there are so many nice and funny moments that make the game really good for me and that I just want to share. 'Mutropolis' is quiet and comical rather than action packed and more detective game than Indiana Jones story. It really manages to surprise and delight with good ideas. Definitely already a small adventure highlight for me this year.&quot;<\/i><br><strong>87\/100<\/strong> - <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.adventurecorner.de\/reviews\/9506\/mutropolis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventurecorner.de, Germany<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1037120\/extras\/Mutropolis_Gameplay.gif?t=1657218534\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A lovely SCI-FI detective point&amp;click adventure - 10-15 hours play time<\/h2><br>It is the year 5000, and the greatest achievements in human history are forgotten.

It is one of those cases where you start playing a game with a &quot;chore&quot; mood and end up with something that is easily one of the best adventures of recent years. It would be a good idea to have a sequel for Pirita Studio, either in the form of a sequel or a completely new product.
