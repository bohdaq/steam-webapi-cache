We wanted to build upon a core tenet of Sairento - an intense no holds barred locomotion system that offered wall-running, power-sliding, backflips and more - all while improving its arcade-style action with semi realistic physics, allowing you to pull off even crazier moves. Juggle enemies in the air. Lop off a limb and use it as a club. Land on an enemy and use them as a bloody surfboard - yes, you read that right.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1341490\/extras\/hellsweepervr-02.gif?t=1655118696\" \/><br>Combat is a core feature of Hellsweeper VR. At the most basic level, you can summon and wield various tools of destruction. Cleave through an undead horde with a claymore. Snipe down flying foes from a distance with an antique rifle. Turn a foe into a pincushion by summoning a salvo of piercing ice shards. Group enemies together with a gravitational vortex.<br><br>Advanced players however, can also adeptly combine both to greater effect. Enchant an ordinary battle-axe into a frost-imbued one, allowing you to chill an enemy on hit. Transmute an arrow with fire, turning it into an explosive projectile. Merge flame and ice to channel a beam of pure arcane energy, cutting through swathes of minions with ease. <br><br>Upgrade and customize your skills, and experiment with unique variations of abilities to discover what being a Hellsweeper really means to you.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1341490\/extras\/hellsweepervr-03.gif?t=1655118696\" \/><br>You have absolute control over your mobility across the battlefield.
