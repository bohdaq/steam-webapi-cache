Monobot is a lot of what I want in a game. It tells its story gradually, has a sci-fi setting, is a good puzzle platformer, and has a fantastic soundtrack.”<br>Thumb Culture Gold Award – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.thumbculture.co.uk\/monobot-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Thumb Culture<\/a><br><br>“Monobot est un jeu indépendant comme on les aime.
