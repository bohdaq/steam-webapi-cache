If anyone is interested in helping work on these items, feel free to reach out on the VR Jetpack Game website.  Longer term, once the more traditional parts of the game are done, the game will take a more open-world \/ sandbox direction as a testbed to integrate other projects of interest, such as introducing some of my plans for the AI project at Conatus.ai (and we can see if people realize when the other players aren't human).","about_the_game":"Physics-based VR with full freedom of flight.
