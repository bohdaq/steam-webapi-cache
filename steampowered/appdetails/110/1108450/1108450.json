The M3A1 is an upgraded version of regular M3 and comes with many improvements. Similar to other US light tanks, the Stuart is extremely mobile and it’s a perfect choice for the quick capture of strategic points in battle. It is equipped with a rapid-reloading 37 mm cannon as well as two machineguns for defending against enemy aircraft and removing the crews of open SPAA vehicles. The exclusive camouflage of this model was used by the United States Marine Corps.<br><br>The P-36A Hawk is an American fighter designed in the 1930s. The aircraft's extremely low wing loading gave it outstanding turning performance, and its high powerful engine gave it great speed up to 479 km\/h. The plane is equipped with one 7.62 mm gun and one 12.7 mm gun. This particular P-36A was flown by Lieutenant Philip M.
