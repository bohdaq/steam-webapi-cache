Anything, that’s what. If it fits, it flies. Start out with a crazy assortment of ammo and add to your arsenal as you level up, flinging and slinging your way to victory!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAny castle defender can crush an enemy with a giant bathtub. It takes that real 300 IQ to throw a car battery at an already launched bathtub to create a deadly electric puddle that will zap your enemies right out of commission.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou’ll have to experiment to become an expert enemy exterminator! Choose your inventory deck carefully and see what damage you can deal as you combine seemingly innocent items from your inventory to create surprisingly deadly effects. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are no limits to your experimentation, amaze the developers themselves with your creativity!

There’s only one way to find out—STAND BACK!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRidiculous Catapult Simulator can be like your ammo, whatever you want it to be! Want to maniacally launch random ammo and watch the world burn? Go for it!

Experiment away, and take requests from the audience while you’re at it!  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWith Ridiculous Catapult Simulator the world is your ammo deck, all ages and gamer levels are welcome. Grab a piñata or whatever else you can imagine and let’s cause some chaos!","about_the_game":"Laugh your silliest evil laugh when playing Ridiculous Catapult Simulator as your enemies fall hilariously to their rag-doll knees under a barrage of bathtubs.
