In the future, the player will be able to expand his company with new and larger bakeries, which will significantly increase production possibilities. And by introducing new products to its offer, it can increase revenues in such stores and thus increase its profits. The player also has marketing campaigns at his disposal, which can significantly affect the number of customers in the player's stores. The number of customers and by the volume of sales can also be influenced by high-quality products, thanks to which the player can win occasional bakery festivals that take place from time to time. <br><br>And with such a strong position, the player can conquer new markets in other cities, creating their warehouses and new stores there.
