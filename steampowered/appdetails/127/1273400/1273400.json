Get back to work with a vehicle fleet whose size will knock your socks off.

As you start from scratch assisted by your mentor Hape, you get bigger and more interesting jobs to grow your company and expand your fleet. You’ll also meet different clients that will challenge you. Tasks like renovating the harbor area to attract more tourists or helping the struggling inner city to recover will demand all your skills.   <br><br>On the European map inspired by the idyllic cities of Southwest Germany, you’ll find rolling hills and beautiful riversides. In Friedenberg your mission is to help design solutions for renewable energy and improve the city’s infrastructure during the campaign. Aside from these larger jobs, you’ll get assorted tasks to test out every bit of equipment that you earn. Take pride in your accomplishments as you ride through the city!   <br><br>Of course, players can look forward to familiar brands and machines from previous installments of the franchise.
