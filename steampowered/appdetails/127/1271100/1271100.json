there are also action parts interspersed. There is what can be considered (unrealistic) violence against enemies, be it fantasy creatures or sometimes animals. There are horror elements in a fantasy setting and the main character (a detective) uses a gun as well as a fantasy weapon against enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages of the game there is In the earliest minutes of the game you see:\r\nA naked body of a woman, preserved in an ice block, not realistically or explicitly shown. Soon after, a man is shown sitting in a chair smoking marijuana in the first circa 10 minutes, described as being for medicinal use, and legal in Boston (the sequence of smoking is not controlled by the player).\r\n\r\nThere is a bar in the game, where alcohol is served, and the investigation (in the past) centers around a murder case - but the violence is rarely realistic. When violent acts are shown in the adventure sections, it's often in service of the story - and the violent acts are often more alluded to (shown with phantom figures or camera angles disguising the details)."}}}}
