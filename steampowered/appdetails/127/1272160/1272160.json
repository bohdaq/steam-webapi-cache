Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap.<br><i><br>Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself.<\/i><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1272160\/extras\/Brante_pen-1.gif?t=1651785086\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features<\/h2><strong><br>At the turn of time<\/strong><i><br>Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate.
