The story takes place inside of the Origin Sectors with each sector acting as its own motherboard. T.O.M, the main antagonist, wishes to gain control of each Sector in an attempt to make a supercomputer from all the Origin Sectors' computer components. Sector VIII is the last surviving Sector and the smallest of all 11 sectors. Damon, the protagonist is the last hope of saving the Sectors and restoring the Origin Sectors to what it once was.
