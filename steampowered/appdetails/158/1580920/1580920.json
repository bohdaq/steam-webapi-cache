These weapons are:<br><br><strong>• Kotenok Sniper Rifle<\/strong>  - This iconic semi-automatic designated marksman rifle is one of the most common weapons in the USSR. Deployed in a similar way as a machine gun, it can suppress an area with accurate gunfire, keeping your enemies at bay. <br><br><strong>• AT-WAD Assault Rifle<\/strong> - Used by special forces such as the Spetsnaz, this silenced automatic rifle features an integrated suppressor, allowing you to shoot more shots before potentially being discovered by your enemy. <br><br><strong> • RLG-7 (Rocket Launcher)<\/strong> - One of the most recognizable and widespread rocket-propelled grenade systems ever produced, the RGP-7 is as Soviet as they come. Utilized to fight armoured and fortified positions in almost every conflict since its creation, it should be perfect for taking down robots as well. <br><br>Weapon attachments included:<br><strong>• 2.7x RLG-7 Scope<\/strong><br><strong>• Kotenok Extended Magazine<\/strong><br><strong>• AT-WAD Extended Magazine<\/strong><br><strong>• LG-7V High-Explosive Round (ammo for the RLG-7) <\/strong><br><strong>• 9x39mm Full Metal Jacket Ammo<\/strong><br><strong>• 9x39mm Armor-Piercing Ammo<\/strong><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1580920\/extras\/Copy_Image_3_616x257.png?t=1620142074\" \/>","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1580920\/extras\/Copy_image_1-616x257_GIF.gif?t=1620142074\" \/><br>The Östertörn survivors are no longer the only ones fighting the war against FNIX.
