{"1580800":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Erannorth Chronicles","steam_appid":1580800,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"dlc":[1900780,1999950],"detailed_description":"<h1>Disclaimer<\/h1><p>Erannorth is inspired by tabletop RPGs and TCG games and has its own unique RPG\/Card Game systems blend. True to its roots, <i> requires a lot of reading<\/i> and trial and error to learn and master. It won't hold your hand at any point, and It has different rules than other Card Games or RPGs that you must learn to enjoy the game. If you find PnP RPGs and TCG games complex, you will probably find Erannorth overwhelming and complex too.<br><br>Erannorth is a slow burn experience that can keep you hooked for hundreds of hours if you let it. There are over 3500 cards, a few hundred character perks, and over 150+ different keywords and mechanics that you can't humanly learn all in a few hours or even in an entire weekend. If you are in a rush to master it or move to the next game in your backlog, you will miss everything this game can offer.<br><br><i>Did I mention it requires a lot of reading and experimentation? Probably, but I can't stress this point enough.<\/i><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><i>Erannorth is the name of the world setting: an alternative Earth, where every myth and legend is real and set in a post-medieval era ready to transition to an age of enlightenment and steampunk wonders. It's also a fully customizable and moddable Card\/RPG game system you can mold with ease to your wishes by editing plain text files. <\/i><br><br>Erannorth Chronicles is an old-school Card Game with tabletop RPG-like progression. A sandbox experience with no main story, designed to give you absolute freedom and endless character customization. You can play any character you want, from a powerful supernatural creature to a low commoner.<br><br>To succeed In your adventures in Erannorth, you must successfully combine RPG character elements and progression with trading card game mechanics. Unlike traditional Card Games, though, your Cards have meaning and grow in power as you gain additional skill ranks, attributes, and perks like spells and abilities in an RPG game. And unlike traditional RPG games, you will fight your battles using your custom Deck of Cards, which you can change and adapt freely in the middle of the fight.<br><br>In a sense, Erannorth is the mad scientist's lab and theorycrafter's paradise - or hell, where you can build hundreds, if not thousands, of different decks and character combinations and *make* them work for you. If you see a card, and all you think is: 'hey, that's too weak, and not: 'how could I build a character around that?' - chances are Erannorth is the wrong game for you. Similarly, if having many choices is something you find overwhelming, then you most likely won't enjoy this game at all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Customization Freedom.<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Create your unique Hero by choosing from 13 Organizations, 13 Species (with 50 variants), and 15 Classes (with 74 specializations), each with different Skills, Perks, Starting Decks, and Card Pools. <br><\/li><li> If you feel overwhelmed, jump into the action instantly with one of the 18 pre-generated characters, or roll a random character.<br><\/li><li> Your Skills will affect both your card pool and the effectiveness of your cards, while your Perks will let you increase specific card effects and tailor your cards around your build. There are no weak or strong cards, as cards have no meaning outside your build.<br><\/li><li> No tedious Unlock systems.
