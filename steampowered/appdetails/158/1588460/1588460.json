You take control of Nora, a &quot;little traveler&quot; who moves from house to house, helping out the little families that live there in exchange for a place to stay for the night. Upon arriving at your newest house, you learn of the plight of the full-sized homeowner, Lidia, who hasn't been able to make rent after losing her husband, Oskar. The small family in the house isn't doing any better, with daughter Aiko taking care of her sick mother alone and worried about the prospect of having to find a new house. Can you save both families and live up to your role as the Little Traveler?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn Little Traveler, you'll spend your time navigating through household environments collecting necessary materials to augment your abilities and solve household problems. Be careful though! You can't get spotted by Lidia or her cat as they traverse the environment alongside you. Can you make it through all three levels without getting caught?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDon't worry, you'll have more than a few tools at your disposal to help you with your tasks.
