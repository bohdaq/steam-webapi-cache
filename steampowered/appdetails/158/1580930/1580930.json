I previously planned to go on to a doctoral course, but I decided to concentrate on IEH development! My 19-years-older wife, Wakana, is pregnant and the baby is due in this June. She is working on the new world map of IEH2 with the baby. My 13-year-old daughter, Arua, is also working for various artwork of IEH2, and my sister, Nohn, is supporting them. We family are encouraged by all your comment and very active to develop IEH with <i>hapiwaku !<\/i> (<i>Hapiwaku<\/i> is a Japanese word that means happy and excited.)
