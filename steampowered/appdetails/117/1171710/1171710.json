the Awakening is a hack and slash video game, that takes a player onto a journey to Hell, to battle the dark lord himself, and his army.  Some of the attacks and special abilities, that both the player and enemies wield, will be depicted in a 2D graphical violence, with blood and gore.  For example, enemies might explode or limbs might fly off.  Also, some of the location settings, especially Hell, is depicted in a 2D graphical gore style, with the intension of leaving an unsettling feeling.  Corpses, as well as, the suffering damned, are plentiful in those relevant stages."}}}}
