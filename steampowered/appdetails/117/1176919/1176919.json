The United States, fearing the Japanese would use this strategic location as a base to control the northern Pacific Ocean’s sea lanes, launched an assault in May of 1943. The 2,500 Japanese soldiers, mostly of the 301st Independent Infantry Battalion, were dug-in in the high mountains to defend against the Americans of the 7th and 32nd Infantry Regiments of the 7th Division.

Play nine scenarios on a unique 22”x34” Map that accurately depicts Attu’s harsh terrain. The terrain varies over eight levels in height and features boot-sticking Muskeg, rock-strewn Rough, precipitous Cliffs, and jagged Razorbacks crossing the high peaks of the unforgiving, mountainous landscape. Through the fog and unexpected high winds, known to the Aleuts as “Williwaws”, both sides struggle to hold and take ground. Clevesy Pass, Cold Mountain, Point Able, Engineer Hill, the Sarana Valley, an Prendergast Ridge are all fought over.
