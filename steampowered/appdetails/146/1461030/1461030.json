Explore the pristine beaches, dense jungles, rocky plains, and scorching deserts of planet FMM UV-32. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. You can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth tactics or gaining the high ground will give you an edge over the more vicious dinosaurs roaming the planet.<br>Careful planning and consideration must be taken before every hunt including weapon choice. Will you use a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, or a silent crossbow? Maybe bring along a sidearm just in case. One of the most important items you will need is your handheld M.I.S.T.

Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species, each will react differently to you.
