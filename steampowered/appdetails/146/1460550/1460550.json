Pick a Titan and queue up to play 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3, the first team to eliminate everyone from the other team wins. No grinding, no pay to win, no RNG. Just queue and play.","supported_languages":"English","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/header.jpg?t=1646089326","website":"https:\/\/ringoftitans.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> i3 \/ Phenom II<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Onboard<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> i7 \/ Ryzen 5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GTX 1060 or better<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Mash"],"publishers":["Mash"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":1,"description":"Multi-player"},{"id":49,"description":"PvP"},{"id":36,"description":"Online PvP"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"37","description":"Free to Play"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"},{"id":"70","description":"Early Access"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_8326f1f16734d8b2ed720811539400e94165851d.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_8326f1f16734d8b2ed720811539400e94165851d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_b931075049b3a42b31073168beb15d7e3225ba0a.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_b931075049b3a42b31073168beb15d7e3225ba0a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_8227c241285c70102e2501baf48ba394a6ef3282.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_8227c241285c70102e2501baf48ba394a6ef3282.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_1b62d768a27a632f3f0adb97c97e88f55d038866.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_1b62d768a27a632f3f0adb97c97e88f55d038866.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_02772a93ad95dc25ffdcc8bd41881469da8954dd.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_02772a93ad95dc25ffdcc8bd41881469da8954dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":5,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_60d8a53361d98ad96f7b05e59a614beeb59e9952.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_60d8a53361d98ad96f7b05e59a614beeb59e9952.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"},{"id":6,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_a58a9b18cf5c25188997d4c1f0b8732a4b61e823.600x338.jpg?t=1646089326","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/ss_a58a9b18cf5c25188997d4c1f0b8732a4b61e823.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646089326"}],"movies":[{"id":256868528,"name":"Ring of Titans Gameplay Trailer 1","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256868528\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1642035940","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256868528\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1642035940","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256868528\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1642035940"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256868528\/movie480.mp4?t=1642035940","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256868528\/movie_max.mp4?t=1642035940"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"28 Feb, 2022"},"support_info":{"url":"https:\/\/ringoftitans.com","email":""},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646089326","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1460550\/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1646089326","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
