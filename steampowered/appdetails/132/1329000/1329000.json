You should also remember to carry some food and drink with you as those are crucial resources during your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story<\/h2><br><br>The Last Winter is heavily story-driven, therefore you should hop on to it as much as you ever could. The story of The Last Winter is about the earth that has faced disastrous events when different global crises led to usage of nuclear weapons. Since explosions and radiation most of the human population were wiped out. Those who survived now fought for the resources like food and medicines. Temperature of the earth lowered dramatically due to dust in the atmosphere and many froze to death as they were not used to the cold.

Problem is that resources have started to run out and you have to start traveling south in hope of founding a society, which you have heard about from your nearby living survivor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environment<\/h2><br><br>The Last Winter has beautiful environments inspired by Lapland.

These guns are mostly civilian weaponry, which you could imagine finding in a situation like this game's setting. Shotguns or hunting rifles for example. You should still have a thought when to use guns as resources are in a limit so use those wisely. The Last Winter is not a run and gun type of video game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot<\/h2><br><br>While scavenging surrounding areas you can find useful items like medicine, food and ammo. Remember to search everywhere as loot can be found from the most unexpected places.","about_the_game":"Experience post apocalyptic Finland in this adventurous survival FPS called The Last Winter.
