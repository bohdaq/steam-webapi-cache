I played this for hours at a time, unable to put it down.”<br>90 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/purenintendo.com\/review-kitaria-fables-nintendo-switch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Pure Nintendo<\/a><br><br>“If you’re a fan of games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Rune Factory, you’ll definitely like this title. It has a decent balance of farming and adventure, a solid story and the most adorable characters you will ever see. Since the game is pretty open, you can really go at your own pace, you don’t have to do any of the story quests right away if you feel like opting towards farming and gathering instead. Or if you think you can get away with a limited income, you can mostly forgo the farming and head straight into the adventure! Overall, Kitaria Fables is a wholesome and relaxed time.”<br>82 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/cogconnected.com\/review\/kitaria-fables-switch-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >COGconnected<\/a><br><br>“A fantastic tribute to Fantasy Life that nails the kind of grindy combat that many people love, Kitaria Fables is genuinely sweet and impressively well-made for a three-person team in under three years. If Fantasy Life is a Wagyu beef steak, Kitaria Fables is a really, REALLY good burger. If you're jonesing for a tasty action-farming-adventure, Kitaria Fables has you covered.”<br>80 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.nintendolife.com\/reviews\/nintendo-switch\/kitaria_fables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nintendo Life<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1356280\/header.jpg?t=1659089162","website":"http:\/\/pqube.co.uk\/kitaria-fables","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 64 bit Windows 10 \/ 8 \/ 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz \/ AMD FX-8150 3.6GHz or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce GTX 550 Ti \/ Radeon HD 6790 2GB VRAM*<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 4 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> DirectX compatible soundcard<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 64 bit Windows 10 \/ 8 \/ 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i5-4460 3.2 GHz \/ AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 3.6GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce GTX 960 \/ Radeon HD 7950 3GB VRAM*<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 4 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> DirectX compatible soundcard<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"© PQube Ltd.
