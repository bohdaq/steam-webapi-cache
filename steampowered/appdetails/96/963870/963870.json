REPEAT<\/h2>Just like the original board game, each turn is divided into phases:<br>• <strong>Command<\/strong>: Automatically rally your troops, split or merge your squads and exchange weapons. In the command phase, you lay the foundations for a successful turn.<br>• <strong>Fire<\/strong>: Check your line of sight and firepower, and prepare to set the battlefield on fire. If you have any eligible weapon, you can fire smoke instead of attacking and gain extra protection for your units.<br>• <strong>Move<\/strong>: Move any of your units that did not attack during the previous phase, and try not to be taken by surprise: hostile opportunity fire may be just around the corner.<br>• <strong>Enemy Defense<\/strong>: Be ready to defend your squad.
