Lucky for you, your ability to focus has been finely tuned after years of potato chips and video games, giving you the power to slow time and hit em right where it hurts. A variety of weapons and abilities lie at your disposal to use how you please in many different creative ways, and more to be discovered in the expansive land of Carcosa, which is open for you to explore, providing you're clever enough to stay alive and find its secrets. The land holds many forgotten tales, known by few and understood by none. <br><br>With over 200 rooms to explore and many weapons, items, and secrets to find, fans of the genre will find a challenging but fair adventure to be had in the wild lands of Carcosa.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1745520\/extras\/WhipBossFight.gif?t=1658346974\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE A VAST NON-LINEAR WORLD<\/h2><br>Travel to the land of Carcosa where the great capitol city is under siege by an unknown off world invader.
