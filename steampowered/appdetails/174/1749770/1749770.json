Dissatisfied with the club that already existed on campus, Caprice decided to commandeer a room and some loners and form her own. She carries this attitude through most aspects of her life, traveling her own path. Ever bright, optimistic and full of energy, she's always seeking joy around her, without much regard for norms and expectations. She strives to bring this same joy to the friends she's pulled into her orbit, even if they're a little resistant. She tends to be loud, which often gets every eye in the room on her, whether she means it to or not.<br><br>Although Caprice has a childlike enthusiasm to her, she's not naive and innocent.

She's easy to get along with, so people tend to like her, but she avoids social situations if she can.
