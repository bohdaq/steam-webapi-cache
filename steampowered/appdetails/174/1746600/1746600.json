But ultimately, this is a game all about exploration. The island of Akama is vast and wild, reclaimed by nature over many years. There are mountains, beaches, forests and mines, along with some scenery much less familiar. Remnants of vast ruins can be seen all throughout the land. In order to explore these strange - and sometimes dangerous - lands, you will need the help of the Ateyan. By binding your spirit to these creatures, you will be able to uncover the many secrets Akama has to offer. You will use the Ateyan to battle your way through the wilderness, and along the way there will be many unique resources to collect. Your tools will help you scavenge for rare ores and logs, and forage for food in the trees and beneath the waves. Resources will be a huge aid to both you and the Ateyan that choose to follow you, allowing you to unlock special fusion forms and power up your party. Once you feel ready, the player can take their team of Ateyan to one of the many Towers present throughout the island, to try to tackle the strange and mysterious dungeons and puzzles that await them there. Beyond these epic challenges lie answers to the mysteries of the past, and possibly a way forward for the people of the present.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1746600\/extras\/Header2.png?t=1633014043\" \/><br>In a vast ocean landscape, a lone island sits.

Battles are fought with teams of Ateyan on a small grid battlefield, with each team occupying their own side of the field. There are many complex elements to the way these battles play out, but we have done everything we can to make sure that they are not only deep, but accessible and fun to play through.

But, it seems that besides fish and a few birds, no animals live on the island. Instead, small balls of light roam around the wilderness, barely even visible to some  - and not at all to others. They are called Ateyan, and according to history they are much more than they appear to be. In the ancient past the Ateyan appeared, through what is only referred to as The Rift, and they exploded in population and diversity all through the island. For many generations they lived alongside the people of the island, and there are descriptions of all kinds of magical, powerful creatures capable of incredible feats. But it seems somewhere along the line the Ateyan and the humans drifted. The Ateyan remained on the island, but only their spiritual essence could be seen; those same strange balls of light. The rest of their existence fell into a space between this world and the world of the Rift, and there the Ateyan could continue their lives without the disturbance of humanity. It is in this form that they stayed. Now, even their very existence as anything more alive than the rocks and rivers - has come into question. As the player will discover upon beginning their journey, this couldn't be further from the truth.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1746600\/extras\/Header5.png?t=1633014043\" \/><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Monsters to find and train<br><\/li><li>Puzzle filled Dungeons<br><\/li><li>RPG levelling and resource management<br><\/li><li>Quests<br><\/li><li>Hand-crafted world<br><\/li><li>2 player local vs. mode<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1746600\/extras\/Header1.png?t=1633014043\" \/><br>Monster Tribe fuses strategy combat with rpg systems, item collection and dungeons filled with puzzles to pull the player into its world.
