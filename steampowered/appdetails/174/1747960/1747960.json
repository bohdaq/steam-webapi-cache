From the towering moose, Planet Zoo’s largest and heaviest species of deer, to the tiny prairie dog, you can enthral your guests with a range of fascinating North American wildlife.<br><br>Visitors will love watching every new animal display unique behaviours. For instance, the arctic fox, who has the lowest temperature tolerance in the game, hunts by adorably diving face-first into the snow, just as it does in the wild.

You’ll expand the zoo by clearing terrain in order to weave new habitats into the landscape, working around marshy wetland  and letting your creativity flow while providing animals large, naturalistic habitats in which to thrive.<br><br>As well as spearheading planning and construction, you’ll endeavour to increase species diversity by incorporating the North America Animal Pack’s additions.
