The tropical isles of Oshur are reminiscent of a time before the Auraxian war, where research and exploration were the most valued pursuits, and the factions weren't fully divided.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Something for Everyone<\/h2>Oshur was designed with an emphasis on logistics and diversity of gameplay. The towering Trident Relays necessitate air support and quick responses, the lattice has deliberate and strategic cutoffs for squad and platoon leaders to pursue, the beachheads and mid-field bases carve a meaningful role for construction; the open savannahs, sandy beaches, and tropical jungles foster vehicle battles and heavy armor usage; and the hand-crafted designer-driven bases create unique and learnable gameplay spaces for hardened infantry veterans. With this new island battleground, there is something to enjoy no matter your style of gameplay.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/218230\/extras\/0002_-_Oshur_Tridents.png?t=1658161691\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exodus Flotilla<\/h2>The expedition to Oshur took place aboard the new Exodus-class Fleet Carriers. Unlike traditional maps, there are no Warpgates on Oshur, and this flotilla of heavily armed fleet carriers will become your new base of operations. Enemy vehicles that stray too close will be shot out of the sky by the shipboard Particle Projection Cannon.<br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/218230\/extras\/0003_-_Oshur_Flotillas.png?t=1658161691\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Water Mechanics<\/h2>As a part of a massive undertaking, we've completely changed how water works in PlanetSide 2.
