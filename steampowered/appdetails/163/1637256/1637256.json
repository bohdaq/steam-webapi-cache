Indeed, the SD60 is widely considered EMD’s initial “third generation” diesel locomotive.<br>In 1984, EMD first constructed four blue-and-white SD60 demonstrators and through 1991, eight railroads and a leasing company purchased a total of 537 standard-design SD60s. Among the buyers of the powerful SD60 was the Soo Line, which dressed its fleet of 58 units in a red, white, and black livery. The Soo Line was a long-time holding of giant Canadian Pacific and by the early 2000s CP had gained full ownership of Soo Line and consolidated the railroad into the 14,700-mile CP system. Accordingly, the Soo Line fleet of SD60s soon changed their colors to CP’s attractive and brilliant red and white livery. Canadian Pacific’s SD60s remain in service today (with some rebuilt to “-3” specifications) and can be regularly found working in both the United States and Canada.<br><br>The Canadian Pacific Electro-Motive SD60 for Train Simulator features realistic details, controls, and sounds.
