These cooldowns vary across different units, and their attack and movement. You will need to balance these cooldowns and constraints in your building of new units, as well in the actions you command your units making their way to the enemy nexus.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle<\/h2>There are 3 unit types for you to build; infantry, ranged, and mounted. All these units are designed differently depending on the Faction you choose to play in the match. Although the attack values are not different, the units fall into a combat triangle: Infantry &gt; Mounted &gt; Ranged &gt; Infantry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Commanders<\/h2>Along with your choice of Faction to play in the match, you also pick an additional character to take into battle. Each Faction has their own uniquely designed Commander which provides you with passive and active abilities to help your core army.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Artifact <\/h2>The Artifact can be found in the middle of the map. It will spawn five minutes into the match. When the Artifact appears both players have one minute to capture and hold around it.
