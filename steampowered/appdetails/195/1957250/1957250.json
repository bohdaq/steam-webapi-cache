You can close the application after getting log. You don't always have to run it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can Detective Bit Bytes' Toolbox - The Time Machine prevent malicious software?<\/h2>No. It is a monitoring software and it can only read.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Does Detective Bit Bytes' Toolbox - The Time Machine show only harmful or useless content?<\/h2>No. It shows everything. You can even see what Windows Operating System is doing. If you find something suspicious, do not delete or modify anything before doing an investigation. It is dangerous. You can damage your system. The application never delete or modify these files. It only reads.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can Detective Bit Bytes' Toolbox - The Time Machine help for finding rootkit?<\/h2>It depends on the conditions. Rootkits must collaborate with your operating system in someway to do something useful. They come with a driver file that you might see. Also rootkits are old threats. Microsoft is using driver signing procedures for a long time and the operating system does not load them if they are not signed. Modern operating systems also use hardware abstraction layers. New systems are leaving legacy BIOS mode and using UEFI.

You can find the &quot;LogData&quot; folder in the installation folder. But the log files' hashes must be the same to compare. Hash is generated from monitored and excluded paths. If you monitored different paths, you can't compare them.  You can use these file creatively.
