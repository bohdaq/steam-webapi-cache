Missions are comprised of collecting intel, surviving, finding equipment for vendors, and other tasks.  Besides mission objectives, players can scavenge for equipment, resources, and rare items such as souvenirs.  Survival is done through teamwork and staying alert.  Replicating reality, players will have no mini-map or hud, friendly fire is a danger, and equipment has specific functions.  The decisions you make with your loadout will directly affect your gameplay.  Heavier gear will slow you down and make your movements louder but offers better protection and capabilities.  Conversely, lighter gear gives the advantage of faster movement at reduced volume, however, players take more damage and the limited technology can reduce your awareness of the battlefield.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nImmersion   Being in VR, immersion can be taken to a new level.  In-game engagements are slowed down and more intense as players move their bodies and hands to interact with the environment and each other.  Actions are completed by mimicking the same motions as done in reality i.e. loading rounds into magazines, holding the phone to your ear for calls, and taking your backpack off to insert or remove items from the different pockets.  In the HQ, upgrades will be done by assembling the various items to craft higher-tier equipment.  Assembly will be done by hand using parts and tools to build your gear, no more taping F or E keys to magically have a more advanced machine.  Multiple people can work together to accomplish tasks more efficiently.  For example, if you are assembling the generator in your HQ you can assemble one side while your teammate assembles the other.  In-game teamwork is also encouraged, if a member of your squad needs bandages and they are in your backpack, the injured member can collect them from your kit without you needing to remove your pack.  This way you can maintain cover while they patch themselves.","about_the_game":"Gameplay Missions:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMissions can be attempted as solo or up to a 4 person squad.
