The Magician and I would not have been able to do it without all of you.<br><br>On a sad note, there has been a medical emergency within the Workingman Productions family that has taken us away from our work on the game. The game is finished and playable through to the end, except in certain circumstances that we are aware of. We are diligently working to iron out these last few glitches but the medical  situation has prevented us from completing as much as we had hoped before release. Updates to correct these issues will be forthcoming. We will be targeting the middle of March, 2022 for our first major update to repair the remaining bugs. <br><br>Anyone wishing to report bugs to us may do so by emailing tyler@workingman.productions.

There are multiple towns to explore and lots of lore to uncover. There is a lot of real estate for the player to get lost in, uncovering something or fighting to level up. Details... Details... DETAILS!! There is a level of detail I wanted to take the time to acknowledge. There is voice acting for every character in the game. This made the stry more entertaining. I was not met with the burden of reading. There is sound for doors and small moments to capture the player's attention.”<br \/>\r\nChristopher Arsenault<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“Solid presentation, art, music and feel. Combat is solid too. Reminds me of my favorite old school JRPGs. Looking forward to more.”<br \/>\r\n@guardyoursleep<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“This reminds me of Breath of Fire 1.
