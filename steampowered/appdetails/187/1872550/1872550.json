Combat is frenetic, accompanied by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and screams of pain. Civilians' thoughts can sometimes be heard, with references to suggestive material (e.g., “I've got what every woman wants, a 12-inch slide ruler and a 166 IQ”; “My mind says Marilyn, but my nightstick says Betty Page.”). References to drugs may appear in the dialogue (e.g., “Oh God. I need another Valium. Or two. No, make that three”; “I don't know what that fine weed growing out in the cabbage patch is, but it sure looks like it would go great in my pipe.”). Characters are sometimes seen stepping in piles of manure; cows are depicted defecating on the ground. The words “a*shole” and “p*ssies” are heard in dialogue."}}}}
