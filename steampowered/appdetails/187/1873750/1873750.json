After reaching a certain economic development and surviving in competition with other players, you will have the opportunity to build your own space fleet and start exploring space and colonizing other planets. The goal of the game is to regain and maintain control over the Earth. The one who owns the Earth is considered the leader of the rating. If the Earth has no owner, the leader is the one whose planet is closest to the Earth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnlike just RTS, in which the PvP session is designed for a small and finite number of players and the map is available only to the participants of the session, and the session itself lasts only an hour or two.

When you exit the game, the gameplay does not stop, your colonies continue to live and evolve in real time on the server.

In addition, some of the resources are not renewable. Therefore, in order to supply the central regions and, as a result, for a successful game, it is also recommended to colonize planets and build colonies somewhere on the periphery. In case you don't really like the constant PvP battles or you like exploration, the universe is quite large and there are places to hide and develop quietly. You can fly away from the center and explore space and quietly build your galactic empire there.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf at first minutes it seems too hardcore, don't be alarmed, the maps in the game are quite large, and there is a built-in wiki. As you progress, you will have enough time before encountering other players to get comfortable with the controls, learn the rules, and build your starting base and defenses.","about_the_game":"The refugee capsule lands on a uninhabited planet.
