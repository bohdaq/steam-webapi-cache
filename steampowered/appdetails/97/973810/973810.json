use laser blasters to shoot enemy creatures; players can also kick aliens into carnivorous plants, resulting in splatters of green blood. The game depicts some comical TV ads that contain instances crude humor: a phone-sex commercial for a gelatinous blob creature (“Chat with the most seductive soft bodies in space...”); a fast-food commercial showing human limbs going through a meat grinder. In one sequence, players encounter a creature with an anus-like orifice; players' scanning equipment confirms “a festering butthole” and “pile of poop.” During the course of the game, certain plants release a gas that alters the screen and color saturation; text indicates that the plants “disperse thick mists of hallucinogenic spores. Enjoy responsibly.” "}}}}
