story deals with themes of death and loss. Violence is eluded to, but rarely encountered in-game and is never portrayed in an overly graphic fashion.\r\n\r\nDeath of a loved one and mortality are themes central to the plot. Alcohol abuse may be mentioned in passing.\r\n\r\nThe game also features images of crime-scene photography. These photos are not real and were staged specifically for this game."}}}}
