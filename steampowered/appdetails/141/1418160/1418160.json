She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her and that's what happens with the protagonist too.<br>She has a great business and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it. The girl knows that people don't take her seriously because of her looks, but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1418160\/extras\/Sana.png?t=1642070512\" \/><br>Sana is a elf warrior but that's not what her whole personality revolves around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try again than to die a hero.<br>She is a smart, strong woman that has some love for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1418160\/extras\/Georgia.png?t=1642070512\" \/><br>Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally.

She is a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors for the king and people close to him.<br>She lost a close friend in a battle but doesn't tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people, she doesn't see all battles as something that should never exist but more like a necessary evil. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1418160\/extras\/Angami.png?t=1642070512\" \/><br>Angami is a strong but weird naga warrior.

Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC's kindness and falls in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people so that was never a problem for her, so she can't explain how the protagonist managed to refuse her advances in the first night.<br>She is almost never serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as a gesture of gratitude.
