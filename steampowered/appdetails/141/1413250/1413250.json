We do too! But we noticed some shortcomings in the genre. They are sometimes hard to set up and inconvenient to play. Some games need too much room or a big table, some require a moderator with godlike precision, some require to close your eyes for minutes, and quite often the game is ruined because someone forgot to do their part correctly or a newbie player asked the wrong question and revealed their secret. We have built Republic of Jungle to address these issues and distill the fun of social deduction games into a more enjoyable and convenient experience. Inspired by Jackbox Games, we have built a platform where players can use their smartphones (or any device with a browser) to play the game.
