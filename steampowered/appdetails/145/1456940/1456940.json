The second team of players, represented by the dangerous, monstrous creatures, must prevent the repairs of the station systems, or neutralize all survivors using a variety of telepathic abilities. The survivors on the space station must use a variety of devices, light sources, and other items to defend themselves against the hostile creatures and avoid total darkness. On a grim space station that has suffered an energetic disaster, the survivors will have to look for access codes, key cards, and other ways to open doors to pave a safe path to the station's breakdown systems. Monster players can see well in the dark and move around the ventilation shafts. They must explore the station, find artefacts to replenish their energy, and beware of bright light using many of their telepathic abilities to help neutralise electronics and the survivors crew.

And so, we took soil samples, collected data, and set course back home. But on the way, something... Something happened... Something we did NOT expect... Communication on the space station was just completely cut off. And our power systems, well... They all began to fail. The station plunged into, what I can only call, pure darkness..
