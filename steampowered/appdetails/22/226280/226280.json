This well-written, well-designed point-and-click adventure please genre fans and — perhaps — might even entice a few newcomers to try this storied genre.”<br>80 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/gamecritics.com\/damiano-gerli\/warp-frontier-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Critics<\/a><br><br>“The game is probably the best of the genre that I have personally played this year, worthy of inclusion in any point-and-click fan’s library as well as a great jumping off point for those wanting to experience what the genre has to offer.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/saveorquit.com\/2021\/10\/08\/review-warp-frontier\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Save or Quit<\/a><br><br>“... it tells a meaningful tale set in a believable future, thoroughly fleshed out and populated by diverse, empathetic characters. Instead of presenting easy answers, it explores difficult questions, buoyed by heart and good humour and mixed through with challenging puzzles. That's a difficult line to tread, and the result is a memorable, occasionally frustrating, but thought-provoking experience. If you're looking for some serious sci-fi, chewy puzzles, or just something a little different, I can definitely recommend diving into Warp Frontier.”<br>70 – <a
