The line was constructed as a twin-track circular loop almost entirely underground, apart from the train depot, serving a total of 15 stations spread across both sides of the River Clyde. The line was built to an unusual 4ft narrow gauge, with tunnel bores of just 11ft, making for a very diminutive train appearance. <br><br>Originally built to be cable-driven, third rail was later installed and energised to be 600V, and following major overhauls in the late 1970s, the line has fitted with Automatic Train Operation, which allowed for a radical transformation in service frequency. To align with this upgrade, a brand-new second generation of rolling stock was built for the line; a fleet of 33 railcars which can operate independently, and up to 3-car formations. <br><br>Now ageing, the second generation of stock is due to be replaced, but it is still working hard below the streets of Glasgow day in, day out, and now in Train Simulator you can experience the full Glasgow Subway line, masterfully recreated by Thomson Interactive! <br><br>Featuring full ATO simulation, you have the power to decide how to drive – manage the line as real drivers do, operating the doors and “ready to start” button, or take on the challenge of driving the line manually, where stopping at stations will take all your skill.
