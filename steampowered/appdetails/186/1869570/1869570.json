(That's why he hates me! Because I &quot;stole&quot; his girlfriend or &quot;spicy seniority&quot; as he would say, just to create a video game, but that was the only way I could persuade him to accept the role in the game. I know you're going to accuse me of being the bad guy for this, but I have my reasons for what I did, because whatever it is, he's my creation and I care about him.)<br>  <br>  Now let's introduce you to some of the game's features:<br><br>1 - Experience an action platformer game with a unique art style<br>2 - Humor<br>3 - Lot of weapons(Sword, bow, sniper, pistol, pineapple, bazooka and things like that) and special abilities for each weapon<br>2+2 - Alzheimer<br>3+7-5 - Experience an action platformer game with a unique art style<br>69 - Spicy Señoritas<br> <br>That's all! <br>Bye!<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1869570\/extras\/rungif.gif?t=1651610924\" \/>","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1869570\/extras\/ezgif.com-gif-maker__2___1_.gif?t=1651610924\" \/><br><br>  Have you ever wondered what the coolest platformer action game looks like, what the smoothest gameplay looks like, or why penguins don't fly?<br>  Well, you won't find these answers here (P.S.
