The only electric shunters of the time were rather dated, their technology coming from 30 years prior, and ÖBB needed something much more modern, capable of forming and breaking up trains in yards much faster than was possible at the time.<br><br>The prototype was found in the E 1200 series, which went through extensive testing in 1979, following which an eventual 50 production locomotives would be produced, the last rolling out the factory in 1991. Featuring a central driving cab, the ÖBB 1063 is perfectly suited for shunting operations, offering a panoramic view of freight yards and equidistant perspectives of nearby rolling stock.<br><br>Despite their age, only a handful of ÖBB 1063s have been retired, with many still in use today on various shunting duties throughout Austria, and thanks to RSSLO, you can experience this locomotive in true form within Train Simulator!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pro Range<\/h2><br>The Pro Range is aimed toward the serious train simulation enthusiast looking for a complex machine to master.
