Insane prophets predict a coming apocalypse. Blood cults openly perform sacrifices... You will lead the last army of the Order of the Gatekeepers and stop the coming chaos.

But keep in mind that not everyone will be happy to fight side by side with other races. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTravel across an open world full of mysteries and dangers. Complete quests. Find rare artifacts and equip your soldiers with them. Improve unit stats, learn new active and passive skills. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShow your tactical genius in challenging turn-based battles. For each battle, choose the fighters who are most suited to take on specific opponents. Consider unit line of sight, facing, morale and accumulated fatigue.
