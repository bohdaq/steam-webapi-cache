Meet Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Entity (AIME), the AI that holds this world together. Sadly, if not predictably, AIME has been infected by an unknown random code, and is wreaking widespread havoc across the land. Bring your best problem-solving skills, a sense of humor, and maybe an extra-large can of WD40 because things are getting a little weird around here.
