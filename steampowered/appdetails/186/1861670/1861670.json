The combination of chess, pet training and cards is pretty good, but I have to deduct one point for the game experience! At present, there are many problems in the game experience. 1. The novice period sends a lot of skill cards, but the skill cards need to consume demons. The novice has no stable way to obtain demons except advertising, so when the skills are used up, it is a decoration, which is not fully charged. 2. At present, the main ways to obtain cards are to open treasure boxes and stores in the wild. You will send the lowest level cards when watching advertisements. Treasure boxes and stores can produce better cards. If you have strength, you can also play elite monsters and explode cards. But in general, it is still difficult to obtain empty cards, and the probability of catching monsters is not high. It may be true random rather than false random. The official suggestion is to control the monster's blood volume within 10, but the existence of counterattack makes it easy to kill the residual blood monster, so it's difficult to do this. I hope this can be taken into account. Suggestions for newcomers: don't bother to catch high-quality pets. Empty cards are basically not enough. You should reasonably allocate empty cards to catch what you need. 3. The vertical screen operation is extremely not smooth. I hope the official can improve it or simply replace it with a horizontal screen. 4. There are also some small problems. For example, capturing the failed sound effect is a little harsh, which can be properly modified and optimized. There are also problems with the server. After saying the disadvantages, mention the advantages. 1. It is a real open world. Although the map is still rough, you can go wherever you want. However, if you go to the high-level area at a low level, you can't fight any strange, and you can only run away all the time 😂    2. Combat is strategic, such as the encirclement and suppression of melee pets, the cooperation of control pets, and auxiliary pets. In addition, the existence of heroes and cards also brings certain operability to players. 3. No krypton gold. Kryptonians may have more resources than the white whoring party, but the core of this game is always pets. Pets are obtained by liver and luck. Personally, I think the main source of kryptonians' combat power in the future should be to buy high-grade pets sold by other players in the auction house. 4. The classic pet training and playing methods bring you childhood fun, It is said that pets will also change their attributes and grow according to your habits (so use more pets you like) 5. There is no physical limit. The combat power of pets is limited by level, and the level grows according to real time, so the training cycle of this game is long. You can catch a powerful pet and cultivate it slowly, or you can catch low-quality monsters to quickly form combat power, and then brush all day to quickly improve your personal level. Your playing method is fairly free. Suggestions: 1. The server continues to adjust, the game ontology needs to be optimized, and some operations are not smooth. 2. For example, there will be a completely unnecessary pause for a few seconds after the failure of catching a pet. This can be optimized. 2. Once a pet is caught, it can only wait for time to grow slowly. There will be no other changes. It will be boring for a long time. I think we can properly develop some new pet training mechanisms, such as evolution, reproduction, variation, etc. 3. Optimize the way to obtain resources. For example, we can hardly obtain demons at the novice stage, which will hit the players' desire to use skill cards, and less use will lead to unskilled when we need to use them in the future, which is contrary to the strategic original intention of the war chess game. There are too few empty cards, which may not be able to meet the desire of some players to catch pets frequently. I hope the official can find a balance. PS: I don't encourage the official to send a lot of cards. It is estimated that making money in this aspect in the future. 4. Leveling is very boring and the process of each battle is not short. It is suggested to launch AI function, which can automatically fight and liberate players' hands. 5. Optimize navigation function, It is recommended to mark the distribution of pets and the existence of tasks on the map, and clearly point out that there are so many at present. I hope the game will be better and better 😆”<br>4 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.taptap.com\/review\/28557392\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TapTap测试服<\/a><br><br>“The game is really good.
