And the captivating locomotives are crafted in exacting detail, feature multiple versions, and wear eye-catching liveries.  <br><br>Among the rollcall of fabled American narrow-gauge railroads, the Denver, South Park &amp; Pacific – the South Park Line -- stood tall. Constructed in the 1870s and 1880s, the railroad extended west from Denver along the South Platte River, then climbed via Kenosha Pass into the heart of Colorado’s rough and tumble mining district. DSP&amp;P’s slim steel rails reached to renowned Leadville and, via Alpine Tunnel at an elevation of more than 11,500 feet, to Gunnison, Colorado. Later controlled by the Union Pacific and renamed the Denver, Leadville &amp; Gunnison, the narrow-gauge line became part of the Colorado &amp; Southern Railway in 1899.  <br><br>Featured in this remarkable Train Simulator pack are DSP&amp;P 2-6-0s constructed by Cooke, a predecessor of the American Locomotive Works (Alco). DSP&amp;P 2-6-0s 71 and 72 carry their original road numbers, while Mogul No. 110 wears its D&amp;LG road number (it was originally DSP&amp;P No. 40). These memorable locomotives were among a group of eight 2-6-0s purchased from Cooke by the DSP&amp;P in 1884. The 70-series engines are equipped with vintage Congdon stacks and No. 71 is provided in both original its livery and a colorful fictional blue livery, while handsome 2-6-0 No. 110 features a straight stack and factory livery. <br><br>Machine Rail has masterfully modeled these remarkable and classic locomotives with extraordinary detail and authenticity. Fashioned from original blueprint specifications, the locomotives feature authentic cab and operating controls, external and internal animations, authentic sounds, realistic water and fuel consumption, working lights and smokebox door, and selectable details such as flags on the pilots.  <br><br>To put the stylish little Moguls to work, this pack also includes scenarios on the period-appropriate and popular Train Simulator Clear Creek Narrow Gauge Route (like the DSP&amp;P, the Clear Creek route was destined to become part of the Colorado &amp; Southern Railway). <br><br>Among the great and memorable experiences of railroading, few could match that of diminutive narrow-gauge steam locomotives battling the towering American Rockies – and you can enjoy it all, from inside the cab with throttle in hand, with the DSP&amp;P Moguls from Machine Rail!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2>Two standard scenarios featuring the DSP&amp;P Moguls on the Train Clear Creek Narrow Gauge Route (route available separately) are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[MR] #01 - The First Run [1\/2]<br><\/li><li>[MR] #02 - Teared Apart [2\/2]<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/325976\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Clear Creek Narrow Gauge Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
