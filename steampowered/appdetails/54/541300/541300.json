The power stations will supply power to substations which can power entire towns.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand the tool system<\/strong> - We’d like to incorporate power tools and additional tools into the game to make fortification a quicker process.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on crafting<\/strong> - With the community's help, we’ll expand on all of the crafting categories such as designing and implementing anything that suits the gameplay and is backed by the community.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand fortification and add vehicle fortification<\/strong> - Additional trap and fortification types like sheet metal, plywood, bars and fencing. Fortifications added to vehicles.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional vehicles <\/strong>- One of our goals is to expand on “mobile survival” such as adding box trucks and eventually trailer trucks which could make for an excellent mobile survival experience.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Vehicle storage and towable generators<\/strong> - Take your loot with you, store goods in on board containers or in trunks. Towable generators and lighting rigs for setting up camp in the wild.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on the leveling system<\/strong> - Do a certain task, gain XP. The more XP, the better you are at doing said task. This will be a simple old school leveling system.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional weapons<\/strong> - Weapons will stay civilian based while not adding anything too over the top when it comes to military weaponry. We’d love to hear your ideas for craftable weapons.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand hunting<\/strong> - Larger game, more small game trapping options.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Fishing<\/strong> - Spend your days shore side with a line in the water, if you think it’s safe.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on design<\/strong> - Added towns, additional town designs and reworks. Sewer systems, a bridge or ferry to Black Island Prison\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Character customization<\/strong> - A full scale character customization feature\u2028 including the implementation of a female character<br><\/li><li><strong>Structure manager<\/strong> - Clean structures, paint, repair, add holiday features, remove furniture, display structure stats.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Grouping system<\/strong> - Players can join a grouping system with friends.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Island wide community missions and events<\/strong> - Come together to clear out larger structures.

How many nights will you survive? Just like all of our features we’ll gather ideas for Steam Achievements from the community. We’ll expand greatly on achievements but you’ll have many to earn in early access such as nights survived, trees felled, times killed, zombies killed etc.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/541300\/extras\/steam_achivement_icons.png?t=1656004027\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plans for Future Updates:<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Expand electrical systems to include full power to the island <\/strong>- The island currently features a massive power station and it has been designed with functionality in mind. The power stations will supply power to substations which can power entire towns.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand the tool system<\/strong> - We’d like to incorporate power tools and additional tools into the game to make fortification a quicker process.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on crafting<\/strong> - With the community's help, we’ll expand on all of the crafting categories such as designing and implementing anything that suits the gameplay and is backed by the community.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand fortification and add vehicle fortification<\/strong> - Additional trap and fortification types like sheet metal, plywood, bars and fencing. Fortifications added to vehicles.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional vehicles <\/strong>- One of our goals is to expand on “mobile survival” such as adding box trucks and eventually trailer trucks which could make for an excellent mobile survival experience.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Vehicle storage and towable generators<\/strong> - Take your loot with you, store goods in on board containers or in trunks. Towable generators and lighting rigs for setting up camp in the wild.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on the leveling system<\/strong> - Do a certain task, gain XP. The more XP, the better you are at doing said task. This will be a simple old school leveling system.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional weapons<\/strong> - Weapons will stay civilian based while not adding anything too over the top when it comes to military weaponry. We’d love to hear your ideas for craftable weapons.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand hunting<\/strong> - Larger game, more small game trapping options.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Fishing<\/strong> - Spend your days shore side with a line in the water, if you think it’s safe.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Expand on design<\/strong> - Added towns, additional town designs and reworks. Sewer systems, a bridge or ferry to Black Island Prison\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Character customization<\/strong> - A full scale character customization feature\u2028 including the implementation of a female character<br><\/li><li><strong>Structure manager<\/strong> - Clean structures, paint, repair, add holiday features, remove furniture, display structure stats.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Grouping system<\/strong> - Players can join a grouping system with friends.\u2028<br><\/li><li><strong>Island wide community missions and events<\/strong> - Come together to clear out larger structures.
