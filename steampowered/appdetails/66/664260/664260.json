Set during the period of Operation OVERLORD (beginning 06 June 1944), Europe In Ruins offers persistent cross-battle XP, hundreds of doctrine selections, and an ongoing PvP warmap campaign. Decide which of 12 battlefield doctrines to follow, then customize your company by selecting from a range of units and upgrades available. Build your company one unit at a time by purchasing them with Manpower, Munitions, and Fuel resources, and then take your company into battle against other players across a wide variety of maps and game modes. Battles are fought over the ongoing warmap campaign, as both Axis and Allied forces fight for control of Europe!<br><br>Europe In Ruins receives regular updates. We are constantly working to develop the mod and to consistently improve our players' experiences.

If a unit survives, it will earn XP for participating in battle, and for every kill. This veterency is recorded and persists beyond the end of the battle. Your battle results will also have an impact on the ongoing campaign, where the Allies have landed in Normandy and must fight to retake Europe, and the Axis must stand firm in their defence of France. But if a unit gets wiped out in battle it will be lost forever, taking their precious veterancy with them. You must choose between giving your units the order to retreat, or holding out to the very last man.<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Unique Gameplay Experience<\/h2>Europe In Ruins also features totally new gameplay features from Company of Heroes. You no longer have a base to build or a tech tree to research, you instead build your company in the launcher before each battle and call your units into battle by requesting the unit “call-ins” you’ve arranged. Units ordered to retreat will retreat off the map entirely, and are out of action until the next battle. Infantry still captures territory, but there are no more flags to capture; territory is instead captured by controlling the sector and driving the enemy out, with more territory granting you a higher Population cap to call units on. All this across 30 custom maps (and counting!)<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Stand-Alone Launcher Application<\/h2>Europe In Ruins uses a unique independent launcher application to handle company creation, doctrine selection, unit management, and for launching battles. Read the latest updates, track the progress and results of other battles, link your Twitch account, and participate in the ongoing online warmap campaign, all through the launcher.<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reward Units &amp; Alternative Skins<\/h2>Reward units are rare historical units that can be purchased using the Gold you earn from battle, and are completely new from Company of Heroes. They can be found in booster packs, traded with other players, or bought and sold on the open market. Many doctrines also have multiple different historically accurate unit skins that can be applied to them, which can be viewed and activated through the in-game Rewards menu.<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quality Of Life Improvements<\/h2>Huge quality of life changes include improved squad AI, improved vehicle pathing, a built-in extended-zoom camera mod, and improved unit ability hotkeys.<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Totally Unique Companies<\/h2>Each player may make a total of 9 doctrine selections for their company, out of a total of 21 selections available to them, giving each doctrine a total of 106,661,318,400 ‬different possible combinations. And that’s before taking unit selection, commander perks, resource bonuses, or playstyle into account!<br><\/li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Active Community &amp; Ongoing Development<\/h2>Europe In Ruins has an active and dedicated playerbase, with players located all across the globe and games available daily.
