When players aren't tackling the main storyline, they'll find themselves in Hub areas where they have the ability to interact with their party members through minigames such as Cooking and Teatime. Interacting with party members in this manner raises Friendship and strengthens them in battle. While the story is mostly linear, the player's friendship with their allies will determine the ending of Episode Three and how Episode Four plays out. Players will be made aware of route-defining decisions.","about_the_game":"<strong>Magnetic Bonds<\/strong> is a fusion of the visual novel and turn-based RPG genres inspired by battle shonen manga!
