Using simple WASD controls, you must guide Jim through the maze, also known as the Evil Dr. Evins' house. You must find you way to the end of the maze while avoiding Dr. Evins' Robots. These robots patrol using random direction movements and chase you when you get too close, adding a bigger challenge to the game.

Unlike most Journalists, Jim does not heap loads of praise on this man. Jim has always been wary of Dr. Evins' increasing power in the political and economic sectors. Jim has been publishing critical news pieces on this shifty doctor on his blog, since no other news agencies will touch such content. Given this criticism, Jim found it odd to receive a call from Dr. Evins himself inviting him to his mansion for an in person interview. So after getting his trusty pen and paper, he went to the not so good doctors house.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter arriving and being let in though an automatic door, Jim interred. However, the door slammed behind him, then the Doctor, talking over his in house PA system, reveled his evil plan because that is what evil doctors do. He told Jim that in the basement of the mansion, he had created a world conquering robot that he will release shortly, to conquer the world Jim surmised. The doctor continued saying that Jim would not see it because his home security robots would kill him before he could get to it. But nothing has kept Jim from a good story, not even killer robots, or the doctor's bleak interior deign. And who knows, he might just be able to stop this mad man's mission.","about_the_game":"Visual Overhaul Update:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&gt;Overhauled visuals<br \/>\r\n&gt;Added Timer to Mazes<br \/>\r\n&gt;Add local leader board to Game so you can track your times.

Robots will chase you once you get too close then will stop once you are far enough away. If a robot is in you way you can try leading it away, just make sure you have room to maneuver.","supported_languages":"English","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/header.jpg?t=1657989215","website":"https:\/\/www.threepillarproductions.com\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Microsoft 64bit Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 64bit Intel compatible Dual Core CPU<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DX11 compliant graphics card<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 15 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Microsoft 64bit Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 64bit Intel compatible Quad Core CPU<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DX11 based graphics card<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 40 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["TPP","ridho_h"],"publishers":["TPP"],"price_overview":{"currency":"UAH","initial":1900,"final":1900,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"19₴"},"packages":[697646],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Jim's Adventure","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":697646,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Jim's Adventure - 19₴","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":1900}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"}],"genres":[{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"4","description":"Casual"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_07a8d3be53255e24aed30e56e6f9e705b43adea2.600x338.jpg?t=1657989215","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_07a8d3be53255e24aed30e56e6f9e705b43adea2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657989215"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_063c3aebbf2eae94f00add87c09540967cb145b0.600x338.jpg?t=1657989215","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_063c3aebbf2eae94f00add87c09540967cb145b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657989215"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_90f8437765600b011394eacb8f54e80891294e36.600x338.jpg?t=1657989215","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_90f8437765600b011394eacb8f54e80891294e36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657989215"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_85f3660d77540194b07ea8e96c8466fa7dc3ce1d.600x338.jpg?t=1657989215","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_85f3660d77540194b07ea8e96c8466fa7dc3ce1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657989215"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_08724ae33fdc5752097872c4118d534afa7fff72.600x338.jpg?t=1657989215","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/ss_08724ae33fdc5752097872c4118d534afa7fff72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657989215"}],"movies":[{"id":256896325,"name":"JA Trailer","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256896325\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1657794039","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256896325\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1657794039","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256896325\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1657794039"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256896325\/movie480.mp4?t=1657794039","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256896325\/movie_max.mp4?t=1657794039"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"4 May, 2022"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"threepillarproductionsstudios@gmail.com"},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657989215","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1936520\/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1657989215","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
