Monsters freely roamed the land and the Gods gave blessings on a daily basis. Truly, it was a hero’s haven, if you knew where to go. Recently, there have been tales of a true monster god roaming the land, Medusa. She is said to have the ability to turn anyone foolish enough to challenge her to stone. Are you foolish enough to test this tale?

Hostile to criticism, the Gloryhound is a braggart, but good for little else.  <br \/>\r\n“The Barbarian” - A true son of the land of Libya.<br \/>\r\nHe claims to be some form of noble, a descendant of an honorable house of Berbers. Or is he a champion from Libya? Or was he a son of Apollo? Either way he's quite the talker and quite the fighter. He can be found in Corinth. Trying to leave and telling tales of his life.  <br \/>\r\n“The Heathen” - Some type of wicked Magos. <br \/>\r\nShe prays to no gods and serves no master. Truly a savage. Her powers come from nature and she is able to commune with the spirits, much better than she can with humans or maybe it's just the Gloryhound. She is rarely found in the city. You'd have better luck finding her in the woods with the other beasts. <br \/>\r\n“The Shrew” - A strong willed young woman. With a mask.<br \/>\r\nA real talker who whatever reason chooses to wear a veil.  Maybe she's a leper. Or like so beautiful she'd bewitch Zeus.  Maybe there's a beard under there. No one knows. She's a lady of real mystery for sure. She’s able to do something called “medicine” but it is more likely she is blessed by Hermes. Whatever the case, she’s a life saver. <br \/>\r\nGrey - A kind old hermit who has taken a liking to the Gloryhound.<br \/>\r\nHe’s great at giving wisdom, though it always seems to be someone else's fault if things go wrong. He’s also great at finding problems for you to solve. Like unnaturally talented at finding things for you to do. <br \/>\r\nMedusa - The Queen of Serpents, the mother of monsters.<br \/>\r\nThe True Villain of the Ancient world. Yes, no question. Truly and unequivocally, wicked, and bad. With a single glance, she can turn you to stone. So beware.","about_the_game":"Long ago, in the dawn of man, before the world could be shaped as it is today, the path to becoming a legend was laid bare for all comers.
