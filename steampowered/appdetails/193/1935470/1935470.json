The game consists of two episodes, each with enjoyable gameplay, its own main characters, storyline, and multiple endings.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game takes place in a flat world resting on the backs of three demon bears. There live—sometimes even of their own free will—favorite characters of pagan and Eastern European folklore. On your way, you will meet bogatyrs, knights, pagans, wild steppe warriors, chorts, vodyanoys, goblins, the Malachite Maid, and even the three-headed dragon Gorynych.

Our mission is to let you plunge into a new breathtaking world and follow a compelling story, making difficult decisions.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA signature soundtrack of more than 30 folklore compositions and voice acting in several languages.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA colorful world, living by its own rules in a thoroughly developed setting. Dozens of locations, characters, and creatures hand-drawn by a team of AAA artists.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA cat. A blue snarky, mean, fluffy cat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLast but not least: we intended each game session to last a couple of hours per episode (there are several of them in the game). Everything so that you can relax in the evening or at the weekend and also have time for something else. An exciting, enjoyable, and unforgettable adventure—that's what we want to give our players.","about_the_game":"The Tales of Bayun is a narrative role-playing adventure set in a dark pagan fantasy world.
