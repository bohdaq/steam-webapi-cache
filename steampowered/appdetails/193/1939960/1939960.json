Then you finish your job and rush to the subway station to go back home. This type of public transportation is essential for us, right? But sometimes despite its importance, subway stations look really scruffy and untidy. They’re just in bad shape, right? Have you ever dreamed of changing it? Make them your little perfect subway? Regardless of your answer, now you can! So be prepared for repairing underground tunnels and decorating them just to prepare the fastest way around the city!<\/strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Renovation<\/h2>There are so many abandoned subway lines waiting for someone to care for them. So start your underground journey by fixing all damages. Pull out those old, useless tracks and put new, shiny ones. You probably wonder where you can get them or other essential tools. The answer is simple – it can be bought from the little, private shop made just for you. Btw, you must be warned. Renovating a subway will be a hard and dirty job, but it’ll also be very entertaining! The train full of fun is waiting for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Decorating<\/h2>Yes, yes – your tunnels look really nice now. Good job! But subway maniacs do not live on putting tracks alone. It’s time for some decorating! Create your own, unique design by carefully choosing all elements. Benches, trash cans, posters, clocks or even flowers – anything needed! You can select nearly everything from a wide variety of available objects. What’s more exciting, some of the stations are based on those in real life! Cool, isn’t it?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage<\/h2>Have you done with building your perfect tunnel? It’s time to prepare for managing the subway. Start with buying some trains. Subway without trains would be just a dark tunnel, don’t you think? Then, hire drivers, prepare routes and timetables… and that’s it! You’re ready for the first day of being a subway’s manager! Watch over the trains to always be on time and take care of the passengers’ satisfaction. From now on, it’s your job to take people to their jobs. And don’t forget about the most important thing…<br><br><strong>…HAVE FUN WHILE PLAYING!<\/strong>","about_the_game":"<strong>You wake up in the morning, go to the subway station to get to work.
