{"1309610":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Line War","steam_appid":1309610,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<h1>Roadmap<\/h1><p>Line War will continue to evolve after the initial launch. The game already has a high replayability value with a great variety of 1v1 matches but the release price reflects that we have plenty of things still in store for Line War. Here is a glimpse at our roadmap which will be actively updated on the official website going forward:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Teams &amp; FFA - Release 35 - Q3 2022<\/h2>According to a survey held in March 2022, this is the most anticipated feature of all with a whopping 56,1% of respondents indicating a desire to play on teams or in chaotic FFA matches. These new playing modes introduce an interesting design challenge on how to solve the picking phase for more than 2 players. The new player modes we are planning are<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 vs 2<br><\/li><li>3 vs 3<br><\/li><li>Free for all<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Aircraft Carrier - Release 36 - Q3 2022<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1309610\/extras\/Carrier.png?t=1655716821\" \/><br>A floating airbase with a capacity of 2 small aircraft (Helicopter, Interceptor, Striker). The developers have been looking forward to adding this unit ever since the release of Alpha 13 - Top Gun back in June 2020. <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Health 320 HP<br><\/li><li>Speed 0.70<br><\/li><li>Production cost 96<br><\/li><li>Energy consumption 8 \/ min<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Technologies - Release 37 - Q3 2022<\/h2>We hope that by introducing many distinct technologies to the game, players will be able to customize their armies in-game. We already see players that follow a very clear doctrine and unit composition from one match to another, almost as if the player was playing another &quot;faction&quot;. Imagine for such players to be able to focus research on these units to give that doctrine\/playing style an even greater bonus.<br><br>Here's an excerpt from among 25 ~ 30 planned technologies:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>SUBMARINE CARGO-HOLD<\/strong> - Room for 1 Infantry or 1 Commando. Enables stealthy infiltration of territory.<br><\/li><li><strong>TOMAHAWK MISSILE<\/strong> - Range 8 missile fired from the Cruiser dealing high impact damage but at long intervals (attrition).<br><\/li><li><strong>INFANTRY FIGHTING VEHICLE<\/strong> - Turns the Tank into an IFV with a cargo-hold of 1 Infantry or 1 Commando.<br><\/li><li><strong>TOWING OF ARTILLERY<\/strong> - Makes it possible for Tanks to tow Artillery. Could be used for retreats or surprise deployments in unsuspected locations.<br><\/li><li><strong>ENGINEERING TEAM<\/strong> - Makes Infantry dig entrenchments 50% faster, with potential for units of other types to jump into, once finished.<br><\/li><li><strong>FASTER CONSTRUCTION<\/strong> - Makes building of all Structures 50% faster. For quick establishment of proxy bases, given that sufficient funds have been saved beforehand.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">E-sports &amp; Season Finals - Continuous<\/h2>Line War was created with e-sports in mind from day one. We know from experience that matches can be very interesting to watch from an observer's perspective. The average duration of a match is approximately 35 min. A global leaderboard based on quarterly seasons is already up-n-running. We want each season to end with live-streamed finals, proposedly in a round-of-32\/double-elimination format. We are hooking up with commentators and collaborators.<br><br>We also intend to find a gaming arena partner, such as SPACE (Stockholm). Here, global finals could be held on a yearly basis.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1309610\/extras\/SPACE.jpg?t=1655716821\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned Features - Q4 2022 ~ Q2 2023<\/h2>The game has yet to see its fullest potential! Many more features have been planned all along and most of them can be found in the original Game Design Document. Take a look at this:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>ADVANCED WORLD ECONOMICS<\/strong> - A slightly more complex, 4X-like world economy with dynamic trade routes, growing cities, and new resources. Less emphasis on pre-defined locations.<br><\/li><li><strong>ORBITAL WARFARE<\/strong> - Rocket gets accompanied by Satellites, Suncatchers, and Orbital Killers, produced at the familiar Launchpad.<br><\/li><li><strong>WORLD IMPROVEMENTS<\/strong> - Seamless west\/east cylindrical worlds, voting, favorites, metadata, visual hints.<br><\/li><li><strong>VICTORY CONDITIONS<\/strong> - Based on 80% territory ownership. Players get notified when any player is close to a territorial victory.<br><\/li><li><strong>STATISTICS &amp; GRAPHS<\/strong> - Detailed end-of-match statistics including graphs for important figures, such as income and size of armed forces.<br><\/li><li><strong>CAPTURE BUILDINGS<\/strong> - Possibility to capture an enemy building, not just destroy it.<br><\/li><li><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE<\/strong> - Build Roads, Bridges, Fortifications, Coastal Turrets, or dig Canals.<br><\/li><li><strong>IMPROVED AI<\/strong> - Smarter unit micro-decisions, flowfield pathfinding, keeping optimal distance for ranged fighters, etc.<br><\/li><li><strong>OBSERVER APPLICATION<\/strong> - Watch a live match with support for switching perspectives and more.<br><\/li><li><strong>ESPIONAGE<\/strong> - Train Spies and assign them to sabotage-, intelligence- or counter-espionage missions.<br><\/li><li><strong>OPERATIONS<\/strong> - Use the F5 through F8 keys to record an Operation (which is basically just a grouping of commands).<br><\/li><li><strong>NEXT GEN COMMAND SYSTEM<\/strong> - We have plenty of ideas on how to make the command system more expressive, efficient, and lean.<br><\/li><li><strong>MORE DEFEND OPTIONS<\/strong> - Switch between light and dense Defend directive. Zig-zag entrenchments and better chances for reinforcements to arrive in time.<br><\/li><li><strong>SHALLOW WATERS<\/strong> - Not traversable by the Cruiser and Aircraft Carrier. Degraded stealth for Submarines.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Future of Line War - Q3 2023+<\/h2>Studio Centurion is committed to the development of this game for years to come!<br><br>We have a clear re-investment strategy and an ambition to fully develop and complete the game according to the original Game Design Document. Our final goal is to have an all-inclusive AA- or AAA product with single-player campaigns. At this stage, LW will already be an established player in the e-sports segment.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><strong>ATTENTION: LINE WAR DOES NOT YET HAVE A SINGLE-PLAYER MODE OR AN AI TO PRACTICE AGAINST.
