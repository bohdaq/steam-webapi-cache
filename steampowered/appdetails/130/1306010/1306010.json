The players will need to navigate through the different Arena Segments, killing all enemies that are sent against them and survive in order to win.<\/i><br><br><strong><i>This is a co-op focused game.<\/i><\/strong> Gather your friends, stay close and coordinate in order to survive. At launch, there will be four available characters to choose from, all different and with unique playstyles.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1306010\/extras\/all_characters.gif?t=1633356982\" \/><br>All Characters share a similar control scheme. However, their Core Attacks, Weaponry, and Skills vary. This will have players make several choices on how they want their character to play out. Character progression is set by earning promotions and each new skill might open a whole new playstyle that you maybe had not yet considered. Do not get cocky though, the waves are randomized and you will not know what exactly comes next. So choose your skills and character wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE BRUTE<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1306010\/extras\/The_Brute_Beta_Gameplay_-_Bada_Space_Station_14.gif?t=1633356982\" \/><br>What happens when you combine Chewbacca and Conan the Barbarian? A furry brutality happens. Revel in the guts of your enemies as the first to enter the action and the last to leave. Use your gigantic Gun-Sword and either dismember or shoot your weakling enemies. Brawns is not the only thing this character has, from Explosive Rounds to Inspiring Brutality, this character has much more than meets the eye.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE PUPPETEER<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1306010\/extras\/Puppeteer.gif?t=1633356982\" \/><br>Like going fast? Like dodging bullets like nobody's business? Like transforming your hand into a boomerang and throwing it around dismembering your unfortunate enemies? Then the Puppeteer is for you. Damage per second is her thing, and she does not shy away from playing dirty by becoming a blob that makes her invisible to her enemies. She can also fuse with other friends or foes, giving advantages or disadvantages to them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE SCARLET MAGNET<\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1306010\/extras\/Scarlet_Magnet.gif?t=1633356982\" \/><br>If you like tanking all the damage and if you like humiliating your enemies by using your Gravity Gun, then the Scarlet Magnet is for you. The best crowd control abilities will be at your disposal and on top of that you can use your Gravity Gun to traverse or manipulate the environment. You don’t like where our level designer has put the explosive barrels? Just pick them up and throw them at the poor souls in front of you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DR.
