It takes place in the same universe as Blue Bottle Games's previous game, NEO Scavenger, and at approximately the same time. Create your captain. Design and fly your custom spaceship. First person, hands on controls and immersive ship interiors. Hire crew and take care of their needs. Then manage your dysfunctional crew and ship as you fend off bankruptcy...or worse. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1022980\/extras\/Create-Your-Captain.gif?t=1648216302\" \/><br><br>In character creation, you’ll use a Career Kiosk to craft your character's history, qualifications, contacts and income.
