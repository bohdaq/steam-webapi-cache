Your partner's killer is on the loose and it's up to you and your team of detectives to solve the case and bring the killer to justice. Be careful not to accuse the wrong person as you only have one chance per playthrough for true justice. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Procedurally generated playthroughs: <br \/>\r\nWith over 10,000 suspect possibilities across 4 different killer types, no two playthroughs are the same. Each time you complete the game, you can play again with different suspects, evidence and evidence locations, and more. This guarantees a unique and replayable experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Investigate crime scenes<br \/>\r\nAs the detective on the case, it is your job to find all of the evidence at each crime scene and connect them together to progress through the case and go to the next crime scene. Once you've gathered enough evidence, you have the crucial decision of charging a suspect with the murder(s).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n-Run your department<br \/>\r\nAs the Detective Chief Inspector, you also have the responsibility of a team of detectives working under you. It is your job to direct them and have them assist you in finding evidence. Your detective teammates will locate evidence and radio in for help in their own unique crime scenes across different cases. You must aid their decision-making to catch suspects.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n-Earn Investigation Points (IP)<br \/>\r\nEach time you collect evidence, complete a crime scene or make a correct decision for your teammates, you will earn Investigation Points (IP). These can be used to unlock the next crime scene to investigate.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Easy &amp; Realistic modes<br \/>\r\nThe Department has two different game modes for players wanting a different approach and playing style. We have “Training” (easy) and “Realistic” (normal). In a realistic playthrough, The Department will be as authentic as possible in your mission to find the killer. Whereas a training playthrough will contain the same aspects as a realistic playthrough, you will gain assistance from your AI teammates and special detection systems. (Evidence will be highlighted when you are close enough to it).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n-Record your own bodycam footage <br \/>\r\nAny good detective knows they need a body cam recording their every move when investigating a crime scene. This is for their own protection, and so they can rewatch, reevaluate, and reexamine what happened when they return to the station. This is why this is a key feature in The Department for you, the detective, to utilise.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Use force if needed <br \/>\r\nThis job isn’t easy, sometimes a suspect will make a run for it and need detaining, and sometimes the only way to detain the runaway is through force. That is why all of our detectives are equipped with tasers and handcuffs.","about_the_game":"The Department is a procedurally generated single-player detective game.
