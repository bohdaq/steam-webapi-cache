You can choose to play as one of the two main characters. Explore their home to learn about their life, while doing that you might encounter NPCs that will also do their thing. This game functions exactly like a digital house that you can walk around inside. The main point is to enjoy the hand-crafted atmosphere and feel the vibe of living in a fictional house as a character. You can do every activity the game offers like reading a book or taking a shower but you can also choose to do none of that and just enjoy existing in the space and admire the art. There will be no goal to work toward, no quest to complete, no progression mechanic and no ending to achieve. <br><br>When you start the game you will start a new in-game day. Each day brings with it a new set of experiences. For example, different food will be served at Lunch and Dinner everyday, the NPCs will have different agenda everyday and will not just stand there at the same place forever. You control how time flows, everytime you eat a meal, time will move forward. Play until night time and go to bed to reset and start a new day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Charming hand-painted graphic<br><\/li><li>Multiple characters to meet<br><\/li><li>A whimsical relaxing experience<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"<strong>THIS GAME OFFERS A SMALL EXPERIENCE<\/strong><br><br>The second installment in the “CARROT” series.
