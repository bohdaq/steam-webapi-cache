(placing characters in a grid with weapons that can attack them before the time ends, with the presence of multiple character types like resistant ones) dates back to 2014, and was conceived by the author of this game, Albert Espín. He started implementing a game based on this concept but eventually moved to another project. In 2016 he proposed this idea to develop a small 2D Android game (at that time though, the characters were robots, not monsters, with simpler 2D graphics) at university. Albert and other students made that robots game, which was praised by early testers due to its engaging gameplay, and obtained the maximum score of the course. Nevertheless, it was never released for Android, although in 2017 Pau Sanchez made a web version of it. <br><br>In 2021, Albert decided to create a new game based on the original game mechanics conceived in 2014, but this time using 3D graphics and Unreal Engine, instead of Android-specific tools, and monsters instead of robots. The resulting game is Save All Monsters! While Albert programmed and designed this game alone, some ideas are based on Pau's web version of the robots game (such as a character ability that insipired the thief ability, or the usage of different level grid rotations). Thanks to Pau's consent to the usage of those ideas here, the current game was made more engaging.<br><br>Enjoy playing the game!","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The game<\/h2><br>Save All Monsters! is a puzzle game where you have to place all the monsters in safe squares before the time ends!
