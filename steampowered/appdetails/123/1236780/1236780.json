game uses a stripping mechanic that leaves enemies in their underwear after combat. One game mode allows players to dress a female character in a revealing outfit (e.g., lingerie\/underwear) and follow the camera as it moves around her figure. The game text and dialogue also contain sexual references. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in dialogue. In one fighting mini-game, players use knives and cleavers to slash at each other, resulting in brief splashes of blood."}}}}
