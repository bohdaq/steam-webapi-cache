In this way, players can see and command their troops how to fight directly, and they can also use the Strategist's thinking to advance and win the game<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game introduces some new concepts, such as supply. The troops need to be supplied to act. When the supply line is cut off, the troops will lose their combat effectiveness in a short time. This way, the enemy can be defeated by cutting off the enemy's supply, therefore, more strategies and tactics can be realized<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game also reproduces the concept of armor and penetrate.
