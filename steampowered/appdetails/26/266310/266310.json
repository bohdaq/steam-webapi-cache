We've created an easy to use and most enjoyable game creator. Join us and our great and enthusiastic game-making community on your journey to make fun games!  Imagine creating a world that you and your friends come together and play... and creating it can be a matter of minutes with no technical jiggery-pokery needed at all :-)  Of course, you can happily spend hours, days..even weeks creating your masterpiece, the great thing about GameGuru is, you won't be held up by learning strange alien languages or using complex modelling tools.

We believe there is nothing on the market which enables you to create and share a 3D game as quickly as GameGuru Classic, thanks to a massive starter collection of assets, our easy drag and drop approach and built-in game logic so you don't need to code it yourself (unless you want to).<br><br>As a welcome bonus, we have also included an expansion pack with over 2.8 GB of additional game assets for you to get started, completely free!
