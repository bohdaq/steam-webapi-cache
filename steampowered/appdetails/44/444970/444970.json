These psychoacoustical phenomena are called HRTF = head-related transfer functions.<br><br>Using these HRTFs, the SSC provides stereo and surround sound on virtual loudspeaker systems for any computer using regular headphones, also giving the choice between stereo and surround sound 5.1, 6.1 and, 7.1.<br><br>Adapted from New Audio Technology’s professional production line, it is a software-based, virtual sound card. It works as the standard audio device of your computer between all stereo and surround audio playback applications and your audio hardware. These include <strong>games and media players like iTunes, Netflix and VLC<\/strong> as well as the main output of your operating system.

The technology of the SSC has been used on Blu-ray releases of well-known Hollywood blockbusters for more than 20 years!<br><br>To <strong>customize the virtualizations<\/strong> to your preferences, the SSC provides a lot of adjustable parameters like the room reflections of the virtual sound studios and the frequency response curve of the headphones you use.
