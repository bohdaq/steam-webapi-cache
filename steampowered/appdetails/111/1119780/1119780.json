The game is built around a core mechanic called “setbacking”, where a player is rewinded back through time.

When the armor breaks, the player is rewinded back to wherever they were a couple of seconds ago. To weaken the armor of other players, you can choose among different weapons, including automatic rifle and grenade launcher, all infused with time-altering technology. Or, if done right, you can turn the tide of a match by using one of the consumable pick-up items, such as the slow-down field.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1119780\/extras\/safe-zone.gif?t=1657195089\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement is key!<\/h2>The various game modes in Setback are designed with fast-paced mobility in mind, keeping the players on their feet at all times. To progress through the stage, you can be creative with several different movement mechanics, like sliding and surface bashing. The race mode, for instance, is a race by foot through a sequence of checkpoints.
