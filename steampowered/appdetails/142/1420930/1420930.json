Move, split and cut slides, and join them together with spectacular transitions — especially, transitions with built-in sounds. Make as many adjustments as you need: crop and rotate pictures, boost colors, normalize sound in clips, and more. Add the music of your choice and have the slides advance following the rhythm of that music. You can also add a voice-over and record images from your webcam or an external device.  The program can now also detect vertical videos and will ask you to change aspect ratios after you upload your file. It is also possible to watch videos on tablets and laptops. Thanks to the Fast Track HD technology, you can now work with HD movies with no lags.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1420930\/extras\/Создание_видео__добав_эффектов,_переходов_титров,_музыки,_стикеров__en.gif?t=1647854118\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Start with the Slideshow Wizard<\/h2>Try the Slideshow Wizard if you’re just starting to use the program. It’s an automated approach that helps you create videos in no time. All you need to do is import your files and choose a theme. The program will create a presentation in the blink of an eye. You can also set the target video length and change the titles. Already have a favorite transition style? Create a custom theme and use it whenever you want.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1420930\/extras\/Start_with_the_Slideshow_Wizard.png?t=1647854118\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Give It the Perfect Look<\/h2>Try zooming in and out of pictures, use the fade-to-black effect, or make your slides roll over. Thanks to the upgraded Pan &amp; Zoom tool, you can now use several presets one by one. Use filters to sharpen details, reduce camera shake, and make your images brighter and more colorful. Use the Transition Wizard to join all clips at once and smooth out the flow of your presentation. You can make it even more dynamic by adding transitions to both main and supplementaryl tracks!  Another cool feature is object tracking: now you can choose scenes featuring your favorite characters and work with them only.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1420930\/extras\/Give_It_the_Perfect_Look.png?t=1647854118\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Audio enhancement<\/h2>Use new audio tools to optimize videos with poor audio quality. Choose the decibel level and get rid of any noises lower than that. Lower the difference between loud and soft noises. With audio effects, you can distort music and voice. But you can also save the original sound — for example, change audio speed without changing the tone. Sound visualizer will help you to eliminate noise jumps during the montage.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1420930\/extras\/Аудиоэффекты_en.png?t=1647854118\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try Hollywood-Style Directing<\/h2>Add a Hollywood touch to your visuals and throw in some special effects. Use Chroma Key to change the background and place your characters in completely different surroundings. Add dynamic elements with the Pan &amp; Zoom tool. Slow-motion will create suspense and have your viewers on the edge of their seats. If you want to cut out scenes with a particular character, try the Scene Detection.
