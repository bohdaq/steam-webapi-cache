This being was feared across the land, and worshipped by those who were too afraid to oppose it.

For years, Redreach's strongest minds attempted to gain some insight into where this being's immense power came from, and how it somehow disappeared from existence altogether. These studies led to the discovery of the Stormrites, a series of powerful scrolls that, in the wrong hands, could lead to the end times.

Deciphering these runes and discovering their true meanings will lead to you as the player being one with the energy that surrounds you. Humans in Stormrite do not have any magical powers, and all power is granted by focus crystals. To cast spells, they must charge their energy via a crystal, with different crystals providing varying buffs and abilities to the character. Certain crystals are extremely hard to find, but in return will provide immense power.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1428600\/extras\/SpellSwitching.gif?t=1651874694\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRAVEL THE LAND AND DISCOVER THE SECRETS THAT LIE WITHIN<\/h2>Explore a vast open-world filled with interesting landmarks and civilisations, learning skills and trades along the way from the people you meet in your journey across Redreach. You will begin in the small mining village of Silverhorn, a quiet settlement that is being terrorised by bandit travellers attempting to take control of the nearby silver mines. Whilst helping defend your neighbors from these thugs, you will discover dark secrets about the village and its residents, and its ties to the legendary tales of the Stormrites.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1428600\/extras\/May2022_Gif4.gif?t=1651874694\" \/><br><br>Along your journey, your character will become increasingly entangled with the storyline of the Stormrites, potentially finding yourself in a position where you must save the kingdom from the terrors that could be unleashed by these powerful scrolls.<br>From the intense droughts of the Southern deserts to the unforgiving winters of the North, Redreach has plenty of regions for you to explore, each with their own stories and legends.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1428600\/extras\/April2022_3.gif?t=1651874694\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHOOSE YOUR PATH<\/h2>With Stormrite's branching skill trees you are given the ability to mould your character into the fighter you want to be.

Your time will be spent going on enthralling quests, exploring the kingdom of Redreach and using various weapons and fighting techniques to dispose of your enemies. The three main styles of fighting are melee, ranged and magic. However, within each of these three categories there are several choices of weapon\/combat style for you to choose.

You are also able to shoot spells into each other, resulting in some very interesting interactions that can be used to increase your options in combat. <br>Melee users also have plenty of choices, with 5 fighting styles (and counting) to choose from, and abilities to aid with your battles.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1428600\/extras\/April2022_5.gif?t=1651874694\" \/><br><br>Stormrite will also have a companion system where you can bring allies on your travels to fight alongside you, either supporting you from behind or soaking up all the attention while you deal the damage from behind.
