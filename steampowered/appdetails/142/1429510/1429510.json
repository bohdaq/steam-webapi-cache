Go back to investigate them, you might figure out you can take them now.\r\n\r\nEven though there are tags with exploration and investigation, it’s actually no difference with an RPG. The only different is you cannot take these items anytime.  They can only be taken when the protagonist realizes it’s useful.\r\n\r\nFor the tag “choices matter”, there are only some in game. The choices you made cannot be reversed. If you make a wrong decision, some candles might be missed and you cannot obtain them anymore.","about_the_game":"This is a game made by RPG Maker 2003.
