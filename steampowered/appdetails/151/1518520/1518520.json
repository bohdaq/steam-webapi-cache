In both games, players explore dungeons while following storylines and engaging in turn-based battles with fantastical enemies (e.g., goblins, demons, monsters). Players select combat moves from a menu screen; characters lose hit points and flash\/flicker when struck. Cutscenes also include instances of violence and blood: a female character lying in a pool of blood; a knight impaled by a lance. One scene depicts a creature being decapitated; some enemies appear as floating severed heads trailing small amounts of blood. Some female creatures are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples), and other characters are shown wearing low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage."}}}}
