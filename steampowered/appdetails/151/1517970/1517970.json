After populating it with different races and creatures, he appointed powerful rulers to govern them and show them the way. But soon they turned against their Creator, seeking to take the world for themselves; and gathered their subjects in two groups that fought each other -- and thus gave rise to war, death and hatred. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1517970\/extras\/gif_steam_02.gif?t=1658830290\" \/><br><br>The all-powerful Chaos was angered, and in His terrible wrath He cast a terrible curse upon the rebellious leaders. He named them King of Darkness and Queen of Light, and condemned them to keep fighting each other forever, until the end of time.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat, always offering a challenge with each encounter, but also resulting in a great sense of pride after completing each challenge. If you are a lover of Metroidvania games, in Aeterna Noctis there is a perfect game mode for you, the Aeterna Mode. However, if extreme challenges and platforming are what you want, you are a Noctis Mode player. But do you know what the differences are between these game modes? We explain it to you.<br><br><strong>- Aeterna Mode (A pure Metroidvania experience)<\/strong><br>In essence, the game has been completely redesigned to offer you as a player a 100% Metroidvania experience where action and exploration are the protagonists. If it's one of your favorite genres, don't miss the opportunity to get lost in a huge open world with 16 unique areas and hundreds of enemies with unique mechanics. The challenge lies in recovering your power and facing fearsome final bosses that will demand the most of you.<br><br><strong>- Noctis Mode (Platforms and extreme challenges)<\/strong><br>We could say that for the first time two genres such as Metroidvania and platform games have been mixed. Playing on this mode, you will not only have to explore and recover your powers, but you will also face constant puzzles, platform sections and challenges only recommended for the most demanding players. If you think this is not for you, we do not recommend playing on Noctis Mode since frustration can ruin the experience. This mode includes all the achievements, so it is also ideal for completionist players or for those who, after beating Aeterna mode, want to enjoy the title again with more difficulty.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1517970\/extras\/escaleras_english.png?t=1658830290\" \/><br><br>In Aeterna Mode, the spikes have been removed from the platforms to make it easier to fight the enemy.
