With the help of the island’s caretaker, you’ll farm, fish, and build as you please in your efforts to turn the ruined village into a thriving new home filled with new friends and family. Gather supplies to build everything from furniture to houses to farming materials, and turn the fruits (and veggies!) of your labor into delicious dishes for yourself or your friends. Over time, you’ll find your tiny community begin to grow as like-minded folks from all over decide to come and open up businesses of their own.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1125510\/extras\/ExploreFishGIF2.gif?t=1655843917\" \/><br>But what about that curse?
